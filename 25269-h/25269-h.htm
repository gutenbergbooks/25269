<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>
In preparing this manuscript the author has had in mind
the needs of young men having no technical instruction
who are anxious to become proficient in the art of Plumbing.
As a consequence each exercise is minutely described and
illustrated; so much so, perhaps, that an experienced mechanic
may find it too simple for skilled hands and a mature
mind. But the beginner will not find the exercises too
elaborately described and will profit by careful study.
Years of experience and observation have shown the author
that the methods herein described are entirely practical
and are in common use today.</p>

<p>The various exercises in lead work will acquaint the
beginner with the correct use of tools and metals. The
exercises in iron pipe work have also been detailed to show
the correct installation of jobs.</p>

<p>Together with the study of this book the subjects of
Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Drawing and English
should be taken. These subjects as they bear on Plumbing
are invaluable to the mechanic in his future connection
with the trade.</p>

<p>The author is indebted for the illustrations of fixtures in
the chapter covering the development of plumbing fixtures,
to the Thomas Maddock's Sons Co., Standard Sanitary
Mfg. Co., and The Trenton Potteries Co.</p>

<h1>ELEMENTS OF PLUMBING</h1>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Plumbing Fixtures and Trade</span></h3>


<p>Modern plumbing as a trade is the arranging and running
of pipes to supply pure water to buildings, the erecting of
fixtures for the use of this supply, and the installing of other
pipes for the resulting waste water. The work of the trade
divides itself therefore into two parts: first the providing an
adequate supply of water; and second, the disposing of this
water after use. The first division offers few problems to
the plumber, little variety in the layout being possible, and
the result depending mostly upon the arrangement of the
pipes and fittings; but the second division calls for careful
study in the arrangement, good workmanship in the installing,
and individual attention to each fixture.</p>

<p>The trade had its beginnings in merely supplying fresh
water to a community. This was done by means of trenching,
or conveying water from lakes, rivers, or springs through
wooden pipes or open troughs. By easy stages the trade
improved and enlarged its scope, until at the present time
it is able to provide for the adequate distribution of tons of
water under high pressure furnished by the city water works.</p>

<p>In the early years of the trade the question of the disposal
of the waste water was easily answered, for it was allowed
to be discharged onto the ground to seek its own course.
But with the increased amount of water available, the waste-water
problem has enlarged until today it plays the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
important part of plumbing, and the trade has had to
change to meet this waste-water problem.</p>

<p>The first simple system of a pipe running from the sink to
a point outside the building was sufficient. As larger buildings
came into use and communities were more thickly
populated, the plumbing problem demanded thought and
intense study. The waste pipes from fixtures had to be so
arranged that it would be impossible for foul odors and
germ-laden air to enter the building through a plumbing
fixture. The importance of this is evidenced by the plumbing
laws now in use throughout the country.</p>

<p>One of the first plumbing fixtures put into common use
was a hollowed-out stone which served as a sink. It was
with considerable interest that the writer saw a sink of this
kind in actual use in the summer of 1915, at a house in a
New England village. This sink had been in service for
about 100 years. From this beginning the well-known
fixtures of today have developed. The demand for moderate
priced, sanitary closets, lavatories, and baths has led
to the rapid improvement seen in plumbing fixtures. In
the development of these fixtures, as soon as a bad feature
was recognized the fixture was at once discarded, until now
the market offers fixtures as mechanically fine as can be
produced. Plumbing fixtures were at first manufactured
so that it was necessary to support them on a wooden
frame, and this frame was enclosed in wood. The enclosure
made by this framework soon became foul and filthy and a
breeding place for all kinds of disease germs and vermin.
This bad feature was overcome by the introduction of open
plumbing, that is, fixtures so made that the enclosure
of wood could be done away with. The open plumbing
allowed a free circulation of air around the fixture and exposed
pipes, thereby making the outside of the fixture and
its immediate surroundings free from all the bad features of
the closed plumbing. Plenty of fresh air and plenty of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
light are necessary for good sanitary plumbing.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig_1" id="Fig_1"></a><a href="images/fig1.jpg"><img src="images/fig1tn.jpg" width="300" height="345" class="plain" alt="Fig. 1.--Pan closet
(English)." title="Fig. 1.&mdash;Pan closet
(English)." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 1.&mdash;Pan closet
(English).</span>
</div>

<p>The materials of which the first open-plumbing fixtures
were made consisted of marble, copper, zinc, slate, iron,
and clay. Time soon proved that marble and slate were
absorbent, copper and zinc soon leaked from wear, iron
rusted, and clay cracked and lacked strength; therefore
these materials soon became insanitary, and foul odors were
easily detected rising from the fixture. Besides these
materials being insanitary, the fact that a fixture was constructed
using a number of sections proved that joints and
seams were insanitary features on a fixture. For instance,
in a marble lavatory constructed by using one piece for the
top, another for the bowl, and still another for the back,
filth accumulated at every joint and seam. Following this
condition, developed the iron
enameled and earthenware fixtures,
constructed without seams
and with a smooth, even, glossy
white finish. The fact that these
fixtures are made of material that
is non-absorbent adds to their
value as sanitary plumbing fixtures.</p>

<p>Another problem which is as
important as the foregoing is the
proper flushing, that is, the supplying
of sufficient water in a
manner designed to cleanse the fixture properly.</p>

<p>The development of sanitary earthenware illustrates
how the above problems were satisfactorily solved. In the
city of London a law compelling the use of drains was enforced,
and in the early 70's the effect of this law was felt
in this country. The introduction at this time of the mechanical
water closet, known as the "pan closet," and the
English plumbing material which was brought to this country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
was the beginning of "American plumbing," which today
outstrips that of any other country in the world. The
"pan closet" continued in use for some time until the "valve
closet" was introduced as a more sanitary fixture. Closely
following these closets, in 1880, the plunger closet became
popular as a still more sanitary fixture. The plunger
closet continued in use until the present all-earthenware
closet bowl drove all other makes from the market. The
American development of the earthenware closet bowl put
the American sanitary fixture far ahead of the English
improvements, as the American earthenware is superior and
the sanitary features of the bowls are nearer perfection.</p>

<p>When the washout bowl was introduced it was considered
perfection. The hopper closet bowl, which was nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
more than a funnel-shaped bowl placed on top of a trap,
was placed in competition with the washout bowl. There
are a number of these bowls now in use and also being manufactured.
However, large cities prohibit their use.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 4.&mdash;Plunger closet.</span>
</div></div>

<p>To quote Thomas Maddock's Sons Co.: "In 1876 Wm.
Smith of San Francisco patented a water closet which employed
a jet to assist in emptying the bowl and the development
of this principle is due entirely to the potter, who had
gradually and by costly experiment become the determining
factor in the evolution of the water closet." With this
improvement it became possible to do away with the boxing-in
of the bowl which up to this time had been necessary.
Closet bowls of today are made of vitreous body which does
not permit crazing or discoloring of the ware. A study of
the illustrations which show the evolution of the closet
bowl should be of interest to the student as well as to the
apprentice and journeyman. The bath tub developed
from a gouged-out stone, in which water could be stored and
used for bathing purposes, to our present-day enameled iron
and earthenware tubs. The development did not progress
very rapidly until about 25 years ago. Since then every
feature of the tub has been improved, and from a sanitary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
standpoint the tubs of today cannot be improved. The
bath tub has become an American custom, as the people
in this country have demanded that they have sanitary
equipment in their homes, while in the European countries
this demand has not developed.</p>

<div class="figs">

<span class="caption">Fig. 5.&mdash;Modern low-tank closet.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The first tubs used in this country were of wood lined with
copper or zinc, and were built in or boxed in with wood
panelling. The plumbing ordinances of today prohibit
this boxing as it proved to be a breeding place for vermin,
etc. As the illustration shows, the woodwork encasing
the tub was in a great many cases beautifully carved and
finished.</p>

<p>The placing on the market of a steel-clad tub, a steel
tub with a copper lining, which did away with the boxing,
was a big improvement as far as sanitary reasons were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
concerned as well as a reduction in cost of tubs. These
tubs were set up on legs which permitted cleaning and
provided good ventilation all around. With these features
they drove all other tubs from the market. The copper
and zinc were found to be hard to keep clean and they were
soon replaced by the iron enamelled and earthenware tubs.
The finish on these tubs being white and non-absorbent
makes them highly acceptable as sanitary fixtures. A
study of the illustrations will show how progress has
been made in design as well as in sanitary features.</p>

<p><b>The Wash Bowl.</b>&mdash;Succeeding the hand basin the first
wash basins used in this country were made of marble or
slate, with a round bowl of crockery. The bowl was 14
inches in diameter originally, but later was changed to an
oval bowl. Like the bath tub these wash stands were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
encased in wood, the encasing being used to support the
marble top. Ornamental brackets were introduced and the
wood encasement done away with.</p>

<p>About 1902 the iron-enamelled lavatory appeared on the
market and drove all other kinds from the market at once.
The reason for this is clear. The marble stands were
absorbent and were made with three parts, top, back, and
bowl; the enamelled iron lavatory is made all in one piece
of material non-absorbent. A study of the illustrations
will show clearly how the lavatory has been improved.
Strange to say, in all plumbing fixtures, and especially the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
lavatory, as improvements were made to make them more
sanitary a reduction has been made in the price of an
individual fixture.</p>

<p>The development of the urinal, showers, wash trays,
drinking fountains and other fixtures I will not attempt to
cover. As the demand has been evident for fixtures of
certain types, the plumber has been alert to anticipate and
supply it. There is need, however, for improvement in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
all our fixtures, especially that part which connects with the
waste pipes, also the hanging, that is the arrangement or
lack of arrangement for hanging fixtures to the wall. The
waste and overflow of all fixtures need considerable change
to make them sanitary. The opportunity is, therefore,
before anyone who will apply himself to this development.
Much money, thought, and time have been spent by the
manufacturers of iron enamelled ware and by the potteries
to gather suggestions made by the plumber in regard to
fixtures, and then to perfect them. To these manufacturers
is due the beautiful design, stability, and perfect sanitary
material which make up our plumbing fixtures of today.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Use and Care of the Soldering Iron. Fluxes.
Making Different Soldering Joints</span></h3>

<p><b>The Soldering Iron.</b>&mdash;The soldering iron is one of the
first tools a plumber has to master. This tool is sometimes
called a "copper bit" as it is made of copper; and so throughout
this book the words "soldering iron," "copper bit,"
"iron," and "bit" are used synonymously. There are
several different-shaped irons in common use today, but
an iron shaped like the one in <a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a> is the one for use in the
following work. Take the iron as it is purchased, having
a wooden handle and the copper exposed on pointed end.
Before it can be used the point must be faced and tinned.
To do this, proceed as follows:</p>

<ol class="lsoff">
<li><i>First</i>, heat the iron on the furnace.</li>

<li><i>Second</i>, place in vise and file the four surfaces of the point.</li>

<li><i>Third</i>, run a file over edges and point.</li>

<li><i>Fourth</i>, heat the iron until it will melt solder.</li>

<li><i>Fifth</i>, put 6 or 8 drops of solder and a piece of rosin the
size of a chestnut on an ordinary red brick. (This rosin is
called a flux.)</li>

<li><i>Sixth</i>, take the hot iron and melt the solder and rosin on
the brick.</li>

<li><i>Seventh</i>, rub the four surfaces of the point of the iron on
the brick keeping the point in the melted solder.</li></ol>

<div class="figs">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig_13" id="Fig_13"></a><a href="images/fig13.gif"><img src="images/fig13tn.gif" width="500" height="61" class="plain" alt="Fig. 13.--Copper." title="Fig. 13.&mdash;Copper." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 13.&mdash;Copper.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The solder will soon stick to the copper surfaces and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the iron is ready for use.</p>

<p>Another way to tin the iron that is in common use is to
rub the point of a hot iron on a piece of sal-ammoniac, or dip
the hot iron in reduced muriatic acid, then rub the stick
of solder on the iron. The use of muriatic acid in tinning
the iron is not recommended. In the first place, it is not
always possible to carry it, and in the second place it eats
holes in the surface of iron, which makes it necessary to file
and smooth the surfaces again. The constant use of
muriatic acid on the copper soon wears it away and makes
it unfit for use. Rosin is easily carried and applied and is
by far the best to use in regular work.</p>

<p><b>Points to Remember in the Care of the Soldering Iron.</b>&mdash;</p>

<ol class="lsoff">
<li><i>First</i>, proper tinning is absolutely necessary for rapid and
good work.</li>

<li><i>Second</i>, do not allow the iron to heat red hot.</li>

<li><i>Third</i>, keep the point of the iron properly shaped.</li>

<li><i>Fourth</i>, use the same flux in tinning as is to be used in
soldering.</li>

<li><i>Fifth</i>, when filing iron, file as little as possible.</li>

<li><i>Sixth</i>, keep in use two irons of the same size.</li></ol>


<h3>FLUX</h3>

<p>A flux is used to clean the surfaces of joints and seams
to be soldered, also to keep them from oxidizing and to
help the metals to fuse.</p>

<p>The following list gives the names of various fluxes in
common use, how they are applied, and on what material
they are most commonly used:</p>

<div class="figs">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="flux uses">

<tr><td>Rosin</td><td><span style="margin-left: 1.2em;">Sprinkled on</span></td><td>Lead, tin, and brass</td></tr>

<tr><td>Muriatic acid (raw)</td><td><span style="margin-left: 1.2em;">With swab</span></td><td>Dirty galvanized iron</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p><b>Rosin.</b>&mdash;Rosin is purchased by the pound and comes in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
chunks. It is very brittle and powders easily. Plumbers
generally take a piece of 1<span class="frac"><span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span></span> N. P. brass tubing, solder a
trap screw in one end and a cone-shaped piece of copper
on the other. The point of the cone is left open. Rosin
is put into this tube and is easily sprinkled on work when
needed.</p>

<p><b>Tallow.</b>&mdash;A plumber's <i>tallow candle</i> answers the purpose
for tallow flux. Some plumbers carry a can for the tallow,
making it cleaner to handle.</p>

<p><b>Muriatic Acid.</b>&mdash;Muriatic acid or hydrochloric acid is
used both raw and reduced. Raw acid is not diluted or
reduced. Reduced acid is made as follows: Put some zinc
chips in a lead receptacle and then pour in the muriatic
acid. The acid will at once act on the zinc. The fumes
should be allowed to escape into the outer air. When
chemical action ceases, the liquid remaining is called reduced
acid.</p>


<h3>PLUMBERS' SOILS AND PASTE</h3>

<p>It is necessary when soldering or wiping a joint to cover
the parts of pipe adjoining the portion that is to be soldered
or wiped so that the solder will not stick to it. There are
a number of preparations for this. The one used by the
best mechanics today is paste, made as follows:</p>

<ul class="lsoff">
<li>8 teaspoons of flour.</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of salt.</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of sugar.</li>
<li>Mix with water and boil down to a thick paste.</li></ul>

<p>The advantages of paste as a soil are many:</p>

<ol class="lsoff">
<li><i>First</i>, it is made of materials easily obtained.</li>

<li><i>Second</i>, solder will not stick to it.</li>

<li><i>Third</i>, if pipe is thoroughly cleaned, the paste will not rub
off easily.</li>

<li><i>Fourth</i>, poor workmanship cannot be covered up.</li>

<li><i>Fifth</i>, when the work is completed, a wet cloth will wipe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
it off and leave the work clean.</li></ol>

<p>Another soil used is <i>lampblack</i> and <i>glue</i>. A quantity of
glue is melted and then lampblack is added. This needs
to be heated and water added each time it is used. This
soil is put on pipes with a short stubby brush. The work
when completed with the silvery joint and jet black borders
appears to the uninitiated very artistic and neat, but when
the black soil is worn away the uneven edges of the joint
appear, disclosing the reason for using a black soil that
covers all defects. The mechanic of today who takes pride
in his ability for good workmanship will not cover his work
with black soil.</p>

<p>It can readily be seen that the use of lampblack soil
encourages poor workmanship, while the use of paste forces,
to a certain extent, good workmanship on the part of the
mechanic.</p>

<p>Before soil or paste is applied, the pipe needs to be
cleansed. Grease and dirt accumulate on the pipe. The
methods employed to remove all foreign matter are simply
to scrape the surface with fine sand or emery paper; sand
and water will also answer for this purpose. This cleans
the surface and allows the soil or paste to stick to the pipe.</p>


<h3>MAKING DIFFERENT SOLDER JOINTS</h3>

<p>The tools used in making the different solder joints as
described and illustrated in this chapter are shown in <a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>.</p>

<p><b>Cup Joint.</b>&mdash;The materials necessary for the work (<a href="#Fig_15">Fig.
15</a>): 12 inches of <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch AA lead pipe, paste, rosin, <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> and
<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> solder.</p>

<p>If a gas furnace is not on the bench to heat the iron, then
a gasoline furnace is necessary.</p>

<p>Each of the following operations must be done thoroughly
to insure a perfect job:</p>

<ol class="lsoff">
<li><i>First</i>, with the <b>saw</b> cut off 12 inches of <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch AA lead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
pipe from the coil. When cutting off a piece of lead pipe
from a coil or reel, always straighten out 1 foot more than
is needed. This leaves 1 foot of straight pipe always on
the coil.</li></ol>

<span class="caption">Fig. 14.&mdash;Tools used for making solder joints.</span>
</div></div>

<ol class="lsoff">
<li>
<p><i>Second</i>, with the flat side of the <b>rasp</b>, square the ends of
the 12-inch piece of pipe. (A good way to do this is to
hold the pipe at right angles with the edge of the bench,
run the rasp across the end of the pipe, keeping the rasp
<i>parallel</i> with the edge of the bench. Apply this to all work
when necessary to square the ends of pipe.)</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, cut the pipe with the saw, making two pieces each
6 inches in length.</p>

<p><i>Fourth</i>, square the ends just cut.</p>

<p><i>Fifth</i>, rasp the edges of one end as shown in the cut. Hold
the work in such a way that the stroke of the rasp can be
seen without moving the pipe.</p>

<p><i>Sixth</i>, take the other 6-inch piece of pipe and with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
<b>turn pin</b> spread one end of it. The turn pin must be
struck squarely in the center with the <b>hammer</b>, the point
of the turn pin being kept in the center of the pipe. The
pipe should be turned after each blow of the hammer.
The pipe must not rest on the bench but should be held
in the hand while using the turn pin. If the pipe bends,
it can be straightened with <b>bending irons</b>. If the pipe is
spread more on one side than the other, the turn pin should
be hit on the opposite side so as to even the spread.</p>

<h3>SEAMS</h3>

<p>A description of the making of wiped seams for lead-lined
tanks will not be attempted as very few are made
now. The plumber, however, is often called upon to make
a seam joining two pieces of sheet lead. The beginner
will do well to go over the following exercise carefully and
practice it thoroughly.</p>

<div class="figs">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig_20" id="Fig_20"></a><a href="images/fig20.gif"><img src="images/fig20tn.gif" width="500" height="210" class="plain" alt="Fig. 20.--Flat seam." title="Fig. 20.&mdash;Flat seam." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 20.&mdash;Flat seam.</span>
</div></div>

<p><b>Materials.</b>&mdash;Two pieces of 8-pound sheet lead, 6 by 10
inches each; one bar of <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> and <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> solder; paste, paper, and
rosin.</p>

<p><b>Tools.</b>&mdash;Rasp, shave hook, and soldering iron.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>The 10-inch side of each piece is rasped and fitted together.
The edges are cleaned and paper is pasted on leaving <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>
inch for solder. Paste without the paper can be put on.
This will make a joint <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> inch wide.</p>

<p>Apply the rosin to the joint, then with the heated iron
and some solder tack the seam on the top, then on the
bottom and middle. This will prevent the seam from
spreading when the lead is heated. Solder and rosin can now
be put on the full length of the joint. With a hot iron proceed
to float the solder down the seam. The soldering iron
must not rest at full length on the pieces of lead or it will
melt the lead and render the work useless. The solder will
flow and form a clean neat seam, if the iron is at the right
heat and the right amount of solder is put on. If the iron is
too hot, the solder will flow instantly when the iron is laid
on it and the solder will disappear as it runs through the
seam. If the iron is too cold the solder will not melt
enough to flow. Too much solder on the seam will cause it
to overflow, that is, the solder will spread beyond the
papered edges. After a little practice this surplus solder
can be drawn in on the seam with the iron and carried
along the seam to some point that has not enough solder.
When the seam is completed the edges should be perfectly
straight and even. The iron is carried along the seam with
one stroke which makes the seam appear smooth and
bright.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mixtures of Solders for Soldering Iron and Wiping.<br />
Care of Solders. Melting Points of<br />
Metals and Alloys</span></h3>


<p>The importance of good solder, that is, solder correctly
mixed and thoroughly cleaned, should not be overlooked.
Work is more quickly and neatly done and the job presents
a more finished appearance when solder that is correctly
made is used.</p>

<p>The solder used in the following work with the soldering
iron is called <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> and <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>. This means <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> (50 per cent.) lead
and <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> (50 per cent.) tin.</p>

<p>In the mixture of solder, only pure metals should be used.
The lead should be melted first and all the dross cleaned
off. The tin should then be added and mixed.</p>

<p>The solder to be used in wiping the joints in the following
chapter is a mixture of 37 per cent. tin and 63 per cent. lead.
This is called wiping solder.</p>

<p>The following table gives the melting points, etc.:</p>

<div class="figs">

<p>To recognize fine solder, run off a bar into a mold and let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
it cool. If there is a frosted streak in the center, the metal
has not enough tin. The surface should be bright. To

is cool, the top should be frosty and the under side should
have four or five bright spots. The amount poured on the
brick should be about the size of a half dollar. If poured on
iron, the metal will cool too quickly and show bright all
over the under side.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Making and Care of Wiping Cloths</span></h3>


<p>A good wiping cloth is essential for wiping joints. The
exact size and the flexibility of the cloth depend a great
deal upon the mechanic who handles the cloth. Some
mechanics like a stiff cloth, but the writer has always used
a flexible cloth. The sizes, shape, and methods of folding
and breaking in as shown in <a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a> below have proved
successful. Cloths made of whalebone ticking are inexpensive
and make the best for ordinary use.</p>

<p>For the joint-wiping jobs to follow, the above sizes are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>

<p>Proceed as follows to cut and complete a cloth:</p>

<ol class="lsoff">
<li><i>First</i>, lay the ticking on the flat bench and square the
sides 14<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> by 14<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> inches.</li>

<li><i>Second</i>, the ticking should be cut off with shears and not
torn or cut with a knife.</li>

<li><i>Third</i>, fold as shown in the cut.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each fold should be moistened with a little water and
pressed with a hot iron. The cloth should not be pulled
or stretched, but should be kept as square as possible.</p>

<p>The first and second folds require a little care; the corners
when folded to the center should be kept in a little, thus
making the outside edge slightly rounded. If this is done,
the corners will not stick out when the cloth is finished.
After the cloth is carefully folded, pressed, and dried, take
a needle and thread and sew the open corners about <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> inch
in from the edge of the cloth. By carefully studying the
cut, one can readily see each operation and, by following
directions, make a perfect cloth.</p>

<p>When the cloth is done, an amount of oil sufficient to soak
through about three layers of cloth should be applied and
then rubbed on a smooth surface. The oil should be rubbed
in well about the edges. It will not be necessary to apply
anything else to the cloth to prepare it for wiping. Paste,
soil, chalk, etc., are not needed and do not benefit the cloth.
When using oil on the cloth, it must not be used too freely,
that is, the cloth must not be soaked in oil, as oil is a rapid
conductor of heat and the cloth would soon become too hot
to handle.</p>

<p><b>Care of Wiping Cloths.</b>&mdash;The ticking will burn if allowed
to become too hot. If hot solder is poured directly on the
cloth, it will soon burn and be destroyed.</p>

<p>Keep the surface on both sides of the cloth well oiled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Use both sides of the cloth.</p>

<p>Use both wiping edges of the cloth.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 22.&mdash;Wiping cloth folded has 16 thicknesses of ticking.</span>
</div></div>

<p>When the cloth is not in use, it should not be thrown in
with the other tools and allowed to curl up into all sorts of
shapes, but should be kept in some flat place. A good way
to keep the cloths is to have two pieces of wood between
which the cloths may be kept and held there by means of
a strap. The length of time which a wiping cloth can be
used depends a great deal upon its making and upon the
care which is given it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Preparing and Wiping Joints</span></h3>


<p>When the writer first started to carry the tools for a
plumber and to prepare joints for wiping, the remark was
often heard that joint wiping would soon be a thing of the
past. I have heard this many times since from many different
sources. Personally, I fail to see the passing of the
wiped joint. More lead pipe is being made today than ever
before, which goes to show that lead pipe is being used and
the only successful way of joining is with the wiped joint.
Some plumbers' helpers of today seem to think that joint
wiping is of no account. To a certain extent, I can sympathize
with them. Most of these boys are learning a
trade in large cities and working for concerns that do nothing
but a large contracting business. This large work is
carried on differently from the small work. Wrought-iron
or steel pipes are used to a great extent in this work and a
very small amount of lead is used. Sometimes the job
will be completed without the use of lead. The boy who
works continually on this kind of work soon comes to think
that lead pipes are no longer in use. The writer has found
that a boy who has learned to do nothing but screw-pipe
work is absolutely lost and cannot perform the duties of a
plumber, other than screw-pipe work. It must be borne in
mind that lead pipe and cast-iron pipe work are being used
today in all parts of the country and in some parts more than
in others. Therefore, the boy must grasp all branches of
the trade that he has chosen to follow and not be a one-sided
man. Joint wiping belongs to the plumber alone. The
plumbing trade differs from all other trades in that it has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
joint wiping for its distinctive feature.</p>

<p>A few attempts at joint wiping will convince the beginner
that it is not the easiest thing in the world to learn. Let me
caution the beginner not to get discouraged. He must have
patience and a firm resolve to master the art of joint wiping
and not let it master him and keep him back.</p>

<p>So, as we now start on exercises of joint wiping, let the
beginner constantly keep in mind that all boys must become
perfectly skilled in the art of joint wiping before they
can be considered plumbers. Keep in mind also that the
examination that one must take to get a plumber's license
contains an actual exercise in joint wiping. The one word
of advice is not to get discouraged. Continued practice is
the only way to success.</p>

<p>The soldering iron is, or should be, conquered by this
time. As joint wiping is the next exercise, I shall go over
a few general points that experience has taught me and
cannot fail to be of assistance to the beginner if they are
heeded. In fact, to become proficient, the beginner should
remember all the points suggested under this heading. It is
necessary in wiping to have good solder. In the chapter on
solder, I have given the correct mixtures and how to recognize
the proper mixtures. The place where wiping is to be
done should be considered. No draught should be allowed
to blow across the work as it tends to chill the solder and
pipe. Proper support for the work should be procured.
If gasoline is to be used for fuel to heat the solder, make sure
that the tank is full before starting, otherwise the fire
may go out just when the heat is needed most and the solder
in the pot has become too cool to wipe with. Have a catch
pan and keep all the solder droppings to put back into the
pot, otherwise the solder will pile up and the fingers are
likely to be pushed into the pile and badly burned. Hold
the ladle about 2 inches above the work, the catch cloth
about 1 inches below. Do not drop the solder in the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
place. Keep moving the ladle. Do not pour the solder on
the pipe in a steady stream, but drop it on. It is not a
large amount of solder that is wanted on the joint at first,
it is heat that is needed. This can be secured better by
dropping the solder on than by pouring a large quantity
on the pipe. The edges of the joint cool very quickly;
therefore heat the edges well and keep them covered with
molten solder until the joint is ready to wipe. When preparing
joints for wiping, always do the work thoroughly
and fit the pieces together tightly so that no solder can get
through.</p>

<h3>HALF-INCH ROUND WIPED JOINT</h3>

<p><b>Preparation.</b>&mdash;Take 12 inches of <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch strong lead pipe
and square off the ends with a rasp. Take the shave hook
and scrape the center of the pipe perfectly bright; a space
3 inches each side of the center is correct. The size of the
joint when completed should be 2<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> inches long. If we
should undertake to wipe the joint with the pipe in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
present condition, the solder would adhere to all the pipe
that was shaved bright. Therefore, we take a piece of paper
sufficient to encircle the pipe twice and after putting paste
on one side of the paper wrap it around the pipe so that the
edge that is cut straight and even is 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> inches from the
center of the pipe. Another piece of paper is pasted on the
other side of the center leaving a clean, bright space of 2<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>
inches. All the pipe should be covered with paper except
the 2<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> inches in the center.</p>

<div class="figs">

<span class="caption">Fig. 23.</span>
</div></div>

<p><b>To Put the Pipe in Position for Wiping.</b>&mdash;The most practical
way is to take two common red bricks with the 2 by 8
face down and place them 9 inches apart. Lay the pipe on
the bricks and place a weight on each end. The solder will
drop on to the bench, so it is best to place a piece of paper
or a pan of black iron under the pipe to catch the solder
that drops. The pan or paper can then be taken up and
the solder put back into the pot without waste. A cast-iron<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
pot holding 15 pounds of solder is then placed on the
furnace. When the solder has melted and has reached 500&deg;
it is ready for use. This can best be determined by putting
a piece of paper in the solder. If the paper scorches, the
solder is at the right heat; if the paper catches fire, it is too
hot.</p>

<p>Now take a 3-inch ladle and heat it over the fire and then
dip it into the solder and skim off any dross that may have
collected.</p>

<p><b>Wiping.</b>&mdash;With the ladle full of solder in the right hand
and the large cloth or the catch cloth in the left hand, begin
to drop the solder on the joint. The cloth should catch all
the solder as it falls off the pipe. If hot solder is held against
the bottom of the pipe, it is heated to the proper heat.
Always begin to drop the solder on the paper edges, then
drop the solder on the joint itself. Bear in mind that the
solder should not be poured on, but dropped on slowly.
After the first few drops do not drop the solder directly on
to the lead pipe but on to the solder previously put on the
pipe. This will save the pipe from burning through.
The pipe must be the same heat as the solder before the
proper heat is obtained for good wiping. The beginner
should practice dropping the solder on the joint, catching
the solder and working it around the pipe. By doing this,
one becomes familiar with the feeling of hot solder, which is
the secret of successful wiping. When the solder works
easily around the pipe, drop the ladle and take the smaller
wiping cloth in the right hand and with both cloths draw all
the solder on top of the pipe. With fingers on the corners
of both cloths, clean off the left-hand edge and with the right
hand draw the surplus solder across to the right-hand edge.
Next, clean the right-hand edge of the joint pushing the
surplus solder onto the cloth in the right hand. Work this
solder on to the bottom of the joint. Now discard the
catch cloth. Holding the wiping cloth with the index<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
fingers on lower opposite corners, shape the under and
front side of the joint. With the middle fingers on opposite
lower corners of the cloth shape the back and top. Keep
the index and middle fingers on the edge of the cloth and
the edge of the cloth on the edge of the joint. This position
together with the size and shape of the cloth will give
the joint the desired form and appearance. Particular
attention is called to the position of the fingers as shown in
the figure.</p>

<p>The last wipe should be a quick stroke coming off of
joint on a tangent. If the solder is at right heat, the cloth
will not leave a noticeable mark. If, however, the solder
is too cold, a ragged edge will result. Sometimes a cross
wipe is made for the last stroke and a good finish obtained.</p>


<p><b>Points to Remember.</b>&mdash;</p>

<ol class="lsoff">
<li><i>First</i>, width of the joint, 2<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> inches.</li>

<li><i>Second</i>, allow no soil or paste to get on the joint.</li>

<li><i>Third</i>, a 3-inch ladle should be used.</li>

<li><i>Fourth</i>, 500&deg; is the working heat of solder.</li>

<li><i>Fifth</i>, paper test for solder heat.</li>

<li><i>Sixth</i>, position of wiping cloths.</li>

<li><i>Seventh</i>, do not drop solder on the lead pipe.</li>

<li><i>Eighth</i>, hold the ladle 2 inches above the pipe.</li>

<li><i>Ninth</i>, wipe the edges of the joint first.</li>

<li><i>Tenth</i>, wipe and shape the joint quickly.</li>
</ol>

<p>The above procedure of wiping will be found to work
out very easily if followed closely. Do not pour the hot
solder onto the cloth as the cloth will burn through and soon
be useless. A little more oil should be put on the cloth
after using it for awhile. The cloth should be turned
around and the opposite side also used. The cloth will
last considerably longer if sides are changed frequently.
The solder should not accumulate on the pan, but should be
continually put back into the pot. The "metal," as solder
is sometimes called, should never be allowed to become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
red hot.</p>

<p>The above method of preparing pipe is suggested for
beginners only and will be found to be a great help to them.
In actual practice the joint must be prepared differently.
The method used in trade is as follows:</p>

<p>The joint is used to join two pieces of lead pipe. Take
two pieces and rasp the four ends square. With the tap
borer clean out the end of one pipe a trifle, then with the
turn pin enlarge this end just a little as shown in the figure.
Then rasp the edge off about <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> inch as shown. Take the
other piece of pipe and rasp one end as was done in the cup
joint, making it fit into the first piece. Then place the
two ends together and with the bending iron beat the pipe,
making the joint as tight as possible.</p>


<h3>ROUND JOINT&mdash;45&deg; TO RIGHT</h3>

<p>The next position in which the beginner is to wipe a joint
is on an angle of 45&deg; to the right.</p>

<p><b>Preparation.</b>&mdash;To prepare this joint, proceed as in the
horizontal round joint. I will enumerate a few of these
points. A piece 12 inches long of <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch pipe is cut off
and the ends squared. A strip in the center, 6 inches long,
is shaved clean. Paper and paste are put over the pipe
except 2<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> inches in the center. Grease can be put on the
pipe in between the pieces of paper and will keep the lead
from oxidizing.</p>

<p><b>Placing Pipe in Position.</b>&mdash;There is no need of an elaborate
system of holding the pipe in position. Take a red brick
and place the 4 by 8 face down. This will do for the bottom
pipe. For the top of pipe to rest on, place two bricks
one above the other; this will give the correct position.
Place the pipe on the brick and with a ladle full of half
molten solder pour a clamp of solder over the end of the
pipe. This will hold the pipe firm for wiping. Place a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
catch pan under the joint for solder to fall in.</p>

<p><b>Wiping.</b>&mdash;The method of wiping this joint is practically
the same as wiping the horizontal joint. The catch cloth
should be held parallel with the bench tilting a little from
front toward the back. The ladle is held the same and
solder is dropped on as before. The ladle should be continually
moving while dropping solder, not allowing the
solder to drop twice in the same place. When the solder
has been worked around the pipe and is at working heat, the
solder is drawn up with both cloths and the top edge wiped
first, then the bottom edge; the surplus solder is put on the
underside of the joint, and then with three or four wipes
the joint is made symmetrical and finished.</p>

<p><b>Things to Remember.</b>&mdash;</p>

<ol class="lsoff">
<li><i>First</i>, prepare like the horizontal joint.</li>

<li><i>Second</i>, use brick to place in position.</li>

<li><i>Third</i>, hold tools as in horizontal joint.</li>

<li><i>Fourth</i>, top edge cools first, therefore, wipe it first.</li>

<li><i>Fifth</i>, hold the wiping cloth at an angle of 45&deg; when wiping,
with fingers placed as noted in previous joint.</li>

<li><i>Sixth</i>, make solder clamp for holding the pipe.</li>
</ol>

<h3>ROUND JOINT 45&deg;&mdash;LEFT</h3>

<p>When the preceding joint is well mastered and a number
of good joints have been wiped, turn the pipe on an angle
of 45&deg; to the left.</p>

<p><b>Preparation.</b>&mdash;The preparation for this joint is exactly
the same as for the horizontal joint. The beginner should
turn back and read carefully concerning the perfection of
the joint. Bear in mind that the pipe must be correctly
prepared or a good joint cannot be made. The edge of
the paper must be cut not torn.</p>

<p><b>Placing Pipe in Position.</b>&mdash;This pipe can be placed in
position the same as the preceding one. If heavy weights
are placed on the ends of the pipe, a bad habit may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
formed by the one learning to wipe. That is, the habit of
pressing hard on the joint when wiping. In the preceding
joint, if the beginner presses too hard, the pipe will fall
off the bricks.</p>

<p><b>Wiping.</b>&mdash;Proceed as described for previous joints. The
top edge must be favored a little. The hot solder will run
down to the bottom edge; therefore less solder should be
dropped on it than on the top edge. When the solder is
at the proper heat for wiping it requires only a light touch
to wipe the joint. If it appears necessary to press hard on
the joint to wipe off surplus solder, it shows that the solder
is not at the correct wiping heat.</p>


<h3>ROUND JOINT&mdash;VERTICAL</h3>

<p><b>Preparation.</b>&mdash;This joint can be prepared exactly like
the preceding one. In fact, the same piece of pipe can be
used throughout. When preparing this joint the end that
is to be on the bottom should be well covered with paper.</p>

<p><b>Placing in Position.</b>&mdash;The best way to hold this joint in
position for wiping is to stand the pipe upright on one end
with the pan underneath. A piece of furring strip should
be run from the top of the pipe to the wall. Secure the
strip to the wall and drive a nail through the strip into the
bore of the pipe. Place a weight on top of the strip and the
pipe is ready.</p>

<p><b>Wiping.</b>&mdash;The procedure of wiping this joint is entirely
different from that in the other positions. The solder is
thrown onto the joint from the ladle. The catch cloth is
held up to the pipe and as much solder as possible is held on
to the pipe. Move the ladle around the joint, throwing a
little solder on as the ladle is moved. Notice now that all
the solder runs to the bottom edge, leaving the top edge
cold. The solder that accumulates on the bottom edge
should be drawn up to the top edge with the cloth. Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
splash more solder on to the top edge and as the solder runs
down the pipe catch it with the cloth and draw it up again.
The solder can be worked around and up and down the joint,
but always keep the top edge covered with hot solder. The
solder is likely to drop off the joint entirely unless watched
closely. When the correct heat is obtained, drop the ladle.
Take the wiping cloth in the right hand and with the fingers
spread, clean off the top edge quickly, then shape the joint
with the one cloth. With a little practice you will gain this
knack. The joint can then be wiped. The left hand can
steady the pipe. Spread the index finger and third finger

<h3>TWO-INCH BRASS FERRULE</h3>

<p><b>Materials.</b>&mdash;The beginner should continue wiping the
vertical round joint until he is able to obtain a symmetrical
bulb. A joint should be
wiped in each of the foregoing
positions for exhibition
purposes, so that the
beginner can have before
him the best work and
strive to make the next
joint better. This next
joint, the 2-inch brass ferrule,
is wiped in an upright
position. The materials
necessary are the 2-inch
brass ferrule, 6 inches of
2-inch light lead pipe, paste
and paper, <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> and <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>
solder, rosin, wiping solder,
catch pan, and supports.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 24.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Tools Required.</b>&mdash;The
tools necessary for this
work are as follows: the
saw, rasp, drift plug,
dresser, file, soldering iron, bending irons, wiping cloths,
shave hook, and ladle.</p>

<p><b>Preparation.</b>&mdash;The lead pipe must be fitted into the brass
ferrule. The brass ferrule has to be tinned first. To do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
this, proceed as follows: file the ferrule for about 2 inches
on the tapered end. Do not file too deep, but just enough
to expose the pure bright metal. Now measure from the
small end 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> inches down toward the beaded end. From
this point to the bead, cover the brass with paste and paper.
No paste must get on the 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>-in. filed end. This end should
not be touched with the fingers. If paste gets on it, the
process of filing must be done over again as the solder will
not stick where there is paste. If the brass ferrule is filed
while the paper is on the brass, the filing will destroy the
straight edge of the paper and an even joint cannot be made.
It would therefore be necessary to re-paper the brass. Take
some powdered rosin and cover the filed end of the ferrule
with molten solder using the rosin as a flux. Do not dip
the end of the ferrule into the hot wiping solder to tin it or
pour wiping solder on the brass ferrule. This method of
tinning the ferrule will spoil the wiping solder. Always use
the soldering iron to tin the ferrule as explained above.
A little practice will develop the use of the iron in the hands
of the beginner so that this tinning process will be done very
rapidly. The iron should be put on to heat when the paper
is being pasted on the brass; the iron will then be ready
for use when needed.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 25.&mdash;Two-inch brass ferrule.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Preparing the Lead.</b>&mdash;The ends of the lead pipe must be
squared with the rasp. All kinks and dents are taken out
by using the drift plug and driving it through the pipe.
Take a piece of smooth pine stick and start to beat in the
end of the lead pipe to fit the brass ferrule. The pipe
should be beaten in starting about <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> inches from the end.
It should be beaten in very slowly until it fits the ferrule.
The pipe is held in the hand all the time and considerable
time should be spent on this as it is the first time the beating
in of lead pipe has been called for. The knack of doing this
comes only by slow and continued practice. The lead must
be "humored" into shape and not "driven" into shape.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
The end of the pipe is tapered still more by rasping off
the end. About <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> inch should extend into the brass
ferrule. With the bending irons, the lead extending into
the brass ferrule is beaten against the inside wall of the
ferrule. A good way to do this is to wedge the lead pipe
in as much as possible at first, then lay the work flat on the
bench, in which position it is more easily worked. The
sketch should be thoroughly studied and each notation
be perfectly understood, before proceeding with the work.
Now that the lead pipe is perfectly fitted into place, it is
prepared for wiping. The joint overall will be 2<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> inches.
As we have already allowed 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> inches on the brass ferrule
for the joint, the lead will have to be cleaned that much
more. With the shave hook, shave the end of the pipe that
has been fitted into the brass ferrule. A space about 4
inches should be cleaned. This will give a cleaned surface
free from dirt and grease for the paste and paper to adhere
to. Next paste the paper in place. The lead pipe can be
entirely covered, or 3 or 4 inches only, above the 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> inches
allowed for the joint. The space between the paper on
the brass and the paper on the lead should now be 2<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> inches.
The paste and paper should now be allowed to dry.</p>

<p><b>Supporting the Pipe.</b>&mdash;This joint is wiped with the
ferrule down on the bench. A flat pan is laid on the bench
and the ferrule stood upon it. A weight on top of the lead
pipe is all that is necessary. If this does not make the
pipe rigid enough for the beginner, then a support similar
to the round vertical joint support can be used. The
beginner is advised, however, to practice the wiping of this
joint with only the weight to hold it in position. The
beginner will then be required to wipe the joint while the
solder is hot, when it does not require a heavy pressure
against the solder to wipe it in shape. These wiped
joints should be supported in place near the furnace
that heats the solder so that the solder will be handy for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
wiping.</p>

<p><b>Wiping.</b>&mdash;Wiping this joint brings in some of the methods
of the round vertical joint. If that joint was thoroughly
mastered, this joint will be wiped considerably more easily.
The ladle is held in the right hand
and the solder splashed on the
joint. The catch cloth is held in
the left hand and some of the
solder is caught and brought up on
the top edge. The top edge cools
quickly as all the hot solder runs
down to the bottom edge and into
the pan. As the solder accumulates
on the bottom edge, it is
drawn up on the top edge, and in
this manner the top edge is kept
hot. When the solder can be
worked freely around the pipe and
the edges are hot, the joint is ready
to wipe. The ladle is laid down
and the wiping cloth is taken in
the right hand and the top edge
of the joint cleaned on one side.
Then the wiping cloth is changed
to the left hand and the other side
of the top edge is cleaned. Holding
the cloth in one hand with the index and the third fingers
spread to the outside corners of the cloth, the cloth is
passed around the joint quickly. To get an even and symmetrical
joint, it is necessary to make two or three passes
around the joint holding the cloth first in the right and
then in the left hand. The free hand is used to steady
the work. This joint should be wiped very slim to allow
room for the caulking irons to pass by it and get into the
hub of the pipe. Constant wiping on the brass ferrule will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
result in the tinning on the brass ferrule coming off. The
ferrule will look black when this happens and will thus be
recognized. The wiping should then be stopped and the
ferrule filed and tinned in the same manner as it was done
at first.</p>

<h3>FOUR-INCH BRASS FERRULE</h3>

<p>The 4-inch brass ferrule joint is the same as the 2-inch,
except for size. The materials needed for this joint are 6
inches of 4-inch, 8-pound lead pipe, and one 4-inch brass
ferrule, one <i>full</i> pot of solder, some paste and paper, rosin,
and <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> and <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> solder.</p>

<p><b>Tools Necessary.</b>&mdash;The tools required for this joint are
as follows: saw, rasp, file, ladle, soldering iron, dresser,
bending irons, shave hook, and wiping cloths.</p>

<p><b>Preparation.</b>&mdash;<i>Lead Pipe.</i>&mdash;With the saw cut off 6 inches
of 4-inch lead pipe. This pipe comes in lengths and should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
be for this work about 8 pounds to the foot in weight. The
pipe may be dented badly, but these dents can be taken out
as follows: Take a piece of 2-inch iron pipe and put it in
a vise. The lead pipe can be slipped over this iron pipe
and any dents taken out easily by beating with the dresser.
One end of the lead pipe is
beaten with the dresser until it
fits into the ferrule. The end
is then rasped a little. Then,
after the brass ferrule has been
tinned, the pipe is fitted into it
and beaten out against the inside
wall of the brass ferrule and a
tight joint is made. The lead
is next cleaned with the shave
hook and paper is pasted on as
explained under the 2-inch brass
ferrule, the description of which
should now be read over.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 270px;">
<a name="Fig_26" id="Fig_26"></a><a href="images/fig26.gif"><img src="images/fig26tn.gif" width="270" height="500" class="plain" alt="Fig. 26.--Four-inch brass
ferrule." title="Fig. 26.&mdash;Four-inch brass
ferrule." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 26.&mdash;Four-inch brass
ferrule.</span>
</div>

<p><i>Brass Ferrule.</i>&mdash;The first thing
to do with the brass ferrule is to
file the end that is to be wiped.
When the brass ferrule is filed,
it should be done away from
any part of the room where the
filings are likely to get into the solder. After the filing
has been done, paper is pasted on all of it except the
part that is to be tinned and no paste must get on
to this part of the ferrule. If any paste does get on
to it, the filing will have to be done over again. When
using paste and paper, neatness must be cultivated, or
paste will be spread over parts of the pipe that are supposed
not to have any paste on them. Next, take the soldering
iron and heat it. Take some rosin and put it on the exposed
part of the ferrule. With the hot soldering iron<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
proceed to tin the brass ferrule, as explained before, with
<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> and <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> solder, using rosin as a flux. Now the lead pipe
that has previously been prepared is fitted into the ferrule.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 226px;">

brass ferrule." title="Fig. 27.&mdash;Four-inch
brass ferrule." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 27.&mdash;Four-inch
brass ferrule.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Supporting.</b>&mdash;Set the brass ferrule on a catch pan. The
lead pipe is upright. A weight placed on top of the lead
pipe will steady the pipe for wiping.
When the joint is wiped the free hand
can hold the pipe if the weight is not
sufficient to support it.</p>

<p><b>Wiping.</b>&mdash;Splash the solder on the
joint from the ladle, in the same
manner as was employed in the two
preceding joints. To get the proper
heat on the 4-inch joint a little more
speed is necessary, also the constant
working of the solder around the pipe.
The ladle is constantly moved around
the pipe so that all parts of the pipe
will be evenly heated and come into
contact with the hot solder direct
from the ladle. When the solder
works freely around the pipe and the
top edge is hot, the joint is shaped by
holding the wiping cloth in the right
hand, with the index and the middle
fingers spread to the opposite corners
of the cloth. The fingers are placed one on the top edge
and one on the bottom edge. The cloth is then passed
around the joint as far as possible. Then the cloth is taken
in the left hand, with the fingers spread, and passed around
the rest of the joint. If the solder does not take the shape
of the cloth readily, then the solder is not at the right
heat. This joint should be wiped very slim to allow room
for the caulking tools. When this joint is once started,
it should not be left until it has been wiped, otherwise a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
large amount of solder will accumulate on the joint and
will be hard to get off.</p>

<h3>STOP COCK</h3>

<p><b>Materials Required.</b>&mdash;The materials used for this joint
are as follows: two pieces of <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>-inch extra strong lead pipe
9 inches long, each; one <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch plug stop cock for lead
pipe; paste and paper; solder; <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> and <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> solder; rosin; catch

<span class="caption">Fig. 28.</span>
</div></div>

<p><b>Tools Necessary.</b>&mdash;The tools necessary for this job are
as follows: saw, rasp, file, turn plug, shave hook, bending
irons, hammer, ladle, soldering iron, and wiping cloths.</p>

<p><b>Preparation.</b>&mdash;There are two joints to be wiped on this
job and the stop cock is supported only by the rigid fitting
of the lead pipe. Therefore the preparation must be
thoroughly done. The brass stop will be prepared first.</p>

<p><i>Brass.</i>&mdash;The two ends of the stop cock are filed bright,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
then papered and tinned. This operation is the same,
only on a smaller scale, as the tinning of the 2-inch and the
4-inch brass ferrule. The paper is pasted over the entire
stop cock, except the two ends, which are tinned for
about 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> inches.</p>

<p><i>Lead Pipe.</i>&mdash;After the lead pipe has been cut off from the
coil, the ends are squared with the rasp. One end of each
piece is reamed out a little with the tap borer and spread
a trifle with the turn pin. With the rasp, take off the outside
edge of the end that has been spread. The sketch
will show this and give the angle at which the edge is to be
rasped. The stop cock is now fitted into the lead pipe.
The brass should enter at least <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> inch, then the lead is
beaten against the brass until a tight joint is made. The
other end of the brass stop is fitted into the other piece
of the lead pipe and a perfect fit is made. The fitting
of these two joints must be rigid as upon them depends the
stability of the joint support. When these ends of the
lead pipe have been fitted, the pipe is cleaned with the shave
hook and paper is pasted on, allowing 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> inches for the
joint. Both pieces of pipe are prepared at the same time
as both ends are wiped at the same time.</p>

<p><b>Supporting.</b>&mdash;The three pieces of pipe should be so
wedged together that they will not fall apart when put in
position for wiping. The bricks for supporting the pipe
are placed the same as in the support of the horizontal
round joint. The lead pipe ends are laid on the bricks.
This brings the stop cock in the center without any support.
If it were not for the substantial fit between it and the
lead pipe, it would not stay in place. Solder straps can
be put over each end of the lead pipe. Weights can be
used to advantage.</p>

<p><b>Wiping.</b>&mdash;When getting the heat up for these joints,
pour the solder over the two joints and over the stop cock.
This gets the heat properly distributed, so that both joints<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
can be wiped while the brass stop is heated. Get the proper
heat up on one joint and then the other. Come back to the
first joint and wipe it and then the second one. Both
joints should be wiped so as to have the same shape. The
novice will experience some trouble when wiping this joint
in getting the brass edge hot. Heating up the two joints
together will in a large degree offset this trouble. Some
mechanics take out the lever handle stop to lessen the
amount of brass to heat. This is never done by a good
mechanic as the two pieces will never fit together again
and make a tight joint. If the plug is left in place, both
the plug and body will expand equally and the pieces will
fit perfectly. When wiping is started on these joints, the
beginner must stay at it continually. When the brass is
heated, the finished wiping can be tried over and over
again. If this way is not followed, the beginner will find
that most of his time will be spent trying to get a heat on
the brass.</p>

<h3>BRANCH JOINT</h3>

<p><b>Materials Needed.</b>&mdash;The materials necessary to complete
this job are as follows: 12 inches of <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>-inch extra strong
lead pipe for the run; 6 inches of <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch extra strong lead
pipe for the branch; paste and paper, and solder.</p>

<p><b>Tools Necessary.</b>&mdash;The tools necessary for this job are
the saw, bending irons, rasp, tap borer, ladle, wiping cloths,
and the shave hook.</p>

<div class="figs">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig_30" id="Fig_30"></a><a href="images/fig30.gif"><img src="images/fig30tn.gif" width="500" height="538" class="plain" alt="Fig. 30.--Branch joint." title="Fig. 30.&mdash;Branch joint." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 30.&mdash;Branch joint.</span>
</div></div>

<p><b>Preparation.</b>&mdash;The preparation of this joint requires<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the skill of the beginner more than any of the preceding
joints. The tapping of the <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> pipe for the branch connection,
pasting and cutting the paper, require the utmost
care and precision. The <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>-inch pipe is tapped with the
tap borer in the center. The tap borer is used by grasping
the handle firmly and putting the cutting point on the
mark and then pressing down on the handle. This
forces the point into the lead. Now turn the tool and
a piece of lead will be bored out. Continue this operation
and a hole will very soon appear in the lead. A
hole just large enough to allow the bending irons to enter
is made. The opening of the hole is completed with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
bending iron, working the lead back slowly into place.
Do not attempt to drive the lead back around the hole
with a few strokes. One bending iron is inserted and this
iron is struck with another iron or hammer. After a number
of strokes the opening will be of sufficient size. The
bent end of iron is inserted into the hole and the bent part
enters the bore of the pipe. This iron is struck in such a
way as to force the lead around the hole up, rather than
back. Now with the straight end of irons open the sides.
When the wall of pipe has been driven up a little the hole
can be enlarged by driving back the lead. This procedure
will form a collar around the hole to steady the branch
pipe. Good workmanship will result in having a good
substantial collar around the opening. The branch should
now be fitted. Clean the pipe with the shave hook for
about 2 inches on each side of the opening. With compasses
set at 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> inches, mark off a space on each side of the
branch on the run, or on the <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>-inch pipe. On the sides of
the pipe the two lines should be joined with an even and
symmetrical curve. A good way to make this curve is
with the shave hook. Now take a folded piece of paper
and cut out the shape of one-half of the joint, then open the
fold and the entire ellipse will be made. When this paper
is cut, a sharp knife is used, otherwise a ragged edge will
be made and a good finish of joint is impossible. The paper
is now pasted and put on the pipe. The surplus paste on
the edge of the paper should be wiped off with the fingers
before the paper is put on the pipe. This prevents any
paste squeezing out on the joint. The branch is now taken
and perfectly fitted into the run. The end is cleaned with
the shave hook and paper is pasted on the pipe, leaving 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>
inches of cleaned surface for wiping. The paste and the
paper should now be allowed to dry. The position for
wiping this joint is to have the run horizontal and the branch
on an angle of 45&deg; pointing away from the wiper. Figure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
30 will bring out the above explanation very vividly.</p>

<p><b>Supporting.</b>&mdash;The run of this joint is laid flat on the table
and the branch inserted in its proper place. With one hand
hold it in place, with the other, use the bending iron, tap
the collar on the run against the branch, wedging it in
place good and strong so that no solder can leak through.
If the branch is tapered with the rasp as shown the joint
can be made very tight. The run of the pipe is now laid
on two bricks as was done with the horizontal joint. The
branch is laid over on a pile of bricks or wood at an angle of
45&deg;. The best way to secure this joint is to pour some
half-molten solder on the ends of pipe and brick, making a
solder clamp. This branch does not need any clamp or
weight if it is properly entered into the run. A strap of
solder can be run over the end of pipe if found necessary.
Place the catch pan under the joint and then the pipe will
be ready to wipe.</p>

<p><b>Wiping.</b>&mdash;In wiping this joint, the catch cloth is used not
only to catch the solder as it drops off from the pipe, but
also to hold the hot solder against the pipe to heat the
under side of the joint. Test the solder and see if it is the
correct heat for wiping. If so, prepare for wiping. After
heating the ladle, take some solder in it and proceed to drop
the molten solder on the joint. The ladle is moved constantly
as the solder is dropped on the run and then on
the branch to get the entire joint to the proper heat. As
the solder drops off from the joint, it is caught on the catch
cloth and brought up on the top of the joint where it is
re-melted by dropping hot solder on it. Then the hot solder
is held in the cloth against the under side of the joint to
get the under side properly heated. The solder is worked
around all parts of the joint. When the heat is got up
sufficiently and the solder works freely around the joint,
the branch cloth is taken and each edge of the joint is wiped
clean. Any surplus solder is brought up on top of the joint<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and then wiped on the catch cloth. This solder is then put
on the under side of the joint. With the branch cloth
reach way around the joint and wipe each side, bringing
the cloth each time to the top and then off the joint. The
last wipe is directly across the top, wiping off any surplus
solder that may have accumulated from wiping the sides.
The difficulty with this joint is in getting the top and bottom
to have an equal amount of solder. With a little practice
and by watching each motion your faults can be noted and
remedied. If the paper starts to come off, it should be
re-papered at once. When the joint is finished, it should
be left in position until the solder has had time to set and
cool, otherwise the branch will break off and considerable
time will be lost in correcting the trouble.</p>

<h3>BRANCH JOINT PLACED FLAT</h3>

<p>When the wiper has mastered the branch joint placed at
an angle of 45&deg;, he can proceed to wipe the joint placed in
the next position, which is flat.</p>

<p><b>Preparation.</b>&mdash;The preparation of this joint is identical
with the preceding one placed at an angle of 45&deg;. If a new
joint is to be prepared, it would be well to pay strict attention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
to the details, such as keeping the paste on the paper
only and having the edge of the paper cut perfectly smooth
and even. Before putting on the paper see that the pipe is
free from all grease and dirt. The paste and paper will
stick better if all the dirt is removed. The branch should
be well fitted into the run of the pipe so that no solder will
get into the bore of the pipe. The branch should not extend
into the run of pipe enough to obstruct the bore of it. If
the instructions for preparing the pipe are not carried out
as detailed, the wiper will experience some trouble that he
may find hard to overcome.</p>

<p><b>Supporting.</b>&mdash;The run can be supported on bricks. The
branch can be supported on a brick placed at its end the
same height as the run. This will bring the joint in the
correct flat position. The branch should point away from
the wiper. Solder straps can now be poured over the ends
of each pipe. If weights are used to hold the pipe firm instead
of solder straps, they should be so placed that they
will not interfere with the hands when wiping.</p>

<p><b>Wiping.</b>&mdash;The wiping of this joint is more difficult as the
beginner will experience trouble in heating the bottom and
keeping the solder on the bottom. Solder is dropped on
the joint and along the pipe so as to bring the pipe to the
proper wiping heat. Some solder will accumulate on top of
the joint. This is melted off on the catch cloth and this
hot solder held against the bottom of the joint. This operation
is repeated until the bottom as well as the top of the
joint is heated properly. When the solder can be worked
freely around the pipe, the branch cloth is taken and each
side is wiped from the bottom toward the top. Solder is
accumulated on the top where it is wiped off on the catch
cloth and put on the bottom of the joint. Now reach way
around each side and wipe the edge and body of the joint,
a wipe across the top completing the joint. The bottom
can be wiped with a cross wipe also if desired. The top and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the bottom should be identical. Notice carefully the drawing
of this joint and endeavor to have the same lines. The
perfecting of these joints comes only with patient practice.
The beginner must not get discouraged because of a burn or
two. As soon as confidence in oneself has been gained, the
possibility of burning the fingers is entirely eliminated.</p>


<h3>BRANCH VERTICAL</h3>

<p>The materials, tools, and preparation for this joint placed
in a vertical position are just the same, practically, as those
in the preceding branch joints. One or two points wherein
they differ are mentioned below. To rigidly support the
joint for wiping, allow the run of the pipe to rest on some
bricks as before mentioned, with the branch looking up.
Now take a piece of wood and drive a nail through one end
of it about 1 inch from the edge. Let this nail enter the
bore of the vertical branch. The wood is allowed to rest on
the back of the bench or is braced against the wall. Supporting
the pipes in this way will allow the wiper perfect
freedom. When wiping this joint, splash the solder on
from the ladle as on the upright joint. As all the sides of
this joint can be seen, it is not a difficult matter to make a
perfectly symmetrical solder bulb. When the proper heat
is gained, the top edge of the joint is wiped first, then the
lower curved edge, using the branch cloth. The body of
the joint is then wiped and the joint finished with a cross
wipe, if necessary.</p>


<h3>BRANCH HORIZONTAL</h3>

<p>The next position for this joint is to have the branch pipe
horizontal and the run vertical. The materials, tools and
preparation for this joint are the same as for the preceding
ones. The supporting and wiping differ a little.</p>

<p><b>Supporting.</b>&mdash;One end of the run is placed on the catch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
pan. The other end is held in place the same way as the
branch was held in the preceding joint. If the pictures of
this joint are carefully looked over, the methods employed
to hold the pipe will be readily noted. The branch is best
held by inserting one end of a bending iron in the bore of
the pipe and placing the other end of the iron on a brick
built up to the right height. The iron should be weighted
to keep the joint from swaying.</p>

<p><b>Wiping.</b>&mdash;The solder is now dropped on the branch as
in the round joint, and splashed on the vertical run as in
the upright joint. Sufficient solder is put on the joint to
keep the edges covered with hot solder. Solder is worked
around the joint until all parts of it are thoroughly heated
and the solder works easily, then all the edges are wiped
clean. The top half is then wiped evenly and the bottom
half wiped to match the top half. A cross wipe in front
completes the joint. When this cross wipe is made on any
joint, a thick edge of solder must not be left. The edge
must be wiped clean. This joint should be wiped first
with the branch pointing to the right and then with the
branch pointing to the left. It will take the beginner some
time to master these branch joints, for not only must they
be wiped symmetrically for the sake of appearances, but
they must be wiped while the solder is hot to secure a tight
joint. A joint that is wiped with solder that is too cold
will be porous and will leak when put under pressure. With
care the same pipe can be used throughout for all the
positions of this branch joint.</p>


<h3>ONE AND ONE-HALF-INCH BRANCH JOINT</h3>

<p>Upon the completion of the small sized branch joint in
its various angles, the 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch branch joint is to be wiped.
This branch joint is wiped in the same positions as the <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>
branch was wiped. The pipe being larger, there is more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
solder for the wiper to handle, and the edges to keep clean
and to wipe are longer.</p>

<p><b>Materials Needed.</b>&mdash;The materials needed for this job
are 12 inches of 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch light lead pipe for the run, and 6
inches of 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch pipe for the branch, paste, paper, solder,
and catch pan.</p>

<p><b>Tools Needed.</b>&mdash;The tools necessary for this job are the
saw, rasp, shave hook, bending irons, drift plug, hammer,
ladle, wiping cloths, and tap borer.</p>

<p><b>Preparation.</b>&mdash;To an experienced wiper, the procedure
of preparing this joint and wiping it are so near like the
<span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>-branch joint that a detailed description would be unnecessary;
but for the benefit of the beginner, I will repeat
the details as they apply to this particular joint and thereby
avoid any error. We will take the preparation of the run
first. Square the two ends of the pipe with the rasp. Mark
off the center of the pipe. With the round part of the rasp,
held at right angles with the pipe, proceed to rasp down the
crown of pipe where the center mark was made. Do not
rasp through the wall of the pipe, but just enough so that
the tap borer will enter the pipe with only a slight pressure.
With the tap borer, tap a hole large enough for the bending
irons to enter. Now proceed to enlarge the hole, first
forcing the edges up and then forcing them back, making
the hole larger and making a collar around the hole at the
same time. Continue to open the pipe until the aperture
is large enough for the branch pipe to enter. The bending
irons must not come into contact with the inside wall of
the pipe, for if they do the inside bore will be marred and
be very ragged. As these joints are usually used on waste
lines, these ragged places make an ideal place for lint and
grease to collect and cause a stoppage. To make the inside
of the hole even, a piece of <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch pipe can be used in place
of the bending irons. To cut out the oval from a piece of
paper to fit the joint, fold the paper and cut out one-half<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of the oval. Now unfold the paper and the complete oval
is obtained. The measurements of the oval are taken from
<a href="#Fig_30">Fig. 30</a>, 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> inches each side of the branch lengthwise of
the run. These two lines are connected with a curved line
as shown. This curved line can be made with the shave
hook. Take the large edge of the shave hook and roll it
along between the lines to be joined. A little practice
will perfect one in doing this quickly. The beginner should
make a number of these ovals so that he can get them perfect.
The graceful appearance of this joint depends upon
the neatness with which it is prepared. I do not want the
beginner to think that a graceful shape of the joint is all
that is to be desired or that it is the most essential point.
Further along, perhaps, more vital requirements will be
brought out and the beginner will be made acquainted with
them.</p>

<p>The ends of the 6-inch piece are now squared with the
rasp. The edges of one end are rasped off as shown in the
sketch, making a wedged fit into the run. This end is then
cleaned with the shave hook. Paper is then pasted on to
cover the pipe except the 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> inches cleaned on the end.
This cleaned part forms part of the joint, therefore no paste
or paper must be put on it. The pipe is now fitted into the
run and the collar beaten against it with the bending irons.
The run is now cleaned with the shave hook for about 3
inches each side of the center. The paper oval cut out is
now pasted on the joint. The paste and paper are then
allowed to dry before they are handled further.</p>

<p><b>Supporting.</b>&mdash;The supporting of this joint, which is
placed with the branch on an angle of 45&deg; pointing away
from the wiper, is not a difficult matter. The beginner can
use his own ingenuity for supporting the pipe if conditions
do not warrant the using of the methods previously
described.</p>

<p><b>Wiping.</b>&mdash;The solder should now be tested for heat. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the solder is at the proper heat, the ladle is taken and
heated. Take a ladle full of solder and drop the solder on
the joint. The lead of which this branch joint is made is
considerably lighter than any lead that has been used before.
Therefore, the beginner must drop the solder on
carefully, making sure that the solder is not dropped on the
same spot, for a hole can be burned through the pipe very
quickly. The ladle must be kept moving, then the solder
will not burn through the pipe. The heat is got up on the
pipe by dropping the solder on the run and on the branch,
catching the surplus solder on the catch cloth and heating
the under side of the joint with it. To form the joint, distribute
the solder and then wipe it into shape. Notice that
I said wipe it into shape. A beginner is very apt to try to
push or poke it into shape. This must not be done as it has
a tendency to make the joint lumpy. All the edges are
wiped off clean first, then the body of the joint is shaped and
wiped. When forming the joint, be sure that the bottom
and the top are symmetrical. Do not have one-half larger
than the other. The last wiping strokes are made swiftly
and rapidly. If the wiper will watch his movements and
note the results and then try to improve them, keeping in
mind that a symmetrical joint is wanted with thin edges,
perfection in wiping will come much more quickly than if
no attention is paid to the strokes made when wiping.</p>


<h3>BRANCH JOINT WIPED FLAT</h3>

<p>The materials required for this joint do not differ from
the preceding one. If the pipe used for the branch joint
at a 45&deg; angle is in good shape, it can be used for this joint
by simply changing positions. The tools needed will not
be any different. The ladle and the wiping cloths, of
course will be required. A pair of pliers can be used to
advantage in picking up the hot solder. The wiping cloths<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
should receive a little more oil to keep them soft and pliable.
Oil the edges of the cloths well.</p>

<p><b>Supporting.</b>&mdash;To support this pipe for wiping have each
end rest on a brick. Each end can be weighted to hold it in
place.</p>

<p><b>Wiping.</b>&mdash;To wipe this joint, proceed to drop the solder
on the joint. When the pipe is thoroughly heated and the
solder works freely around the pipe the joint can be wiped.
The procedure is like the preceding one. The wiper is
cautioned to move the ladle constantly while dropping the
solder.</p>


<h3>BRANCH HELD VERTICAL</h3>

<p>After a number of the previous joints have been wiped
successfully, the pipe is placed in such a position that the
branch will be vertical. The supporting of the pipe to
hold the joint in this position for wiping is very easily done
after handling the <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>-in. joint in this position. The following
points may be found helpful: The solder is splashed on
the joint from the ladle. The top edge of the joint is kept
hot by keeping the solder covering it. When the proper
heat has been got up, the top edge is wiped first, then the
bottom edges both front and back. The body of the joint
is wiped last and a cross wipe finishes the joint. I have
found that the beginner in many cases, when this joint is
reached, tries to wipe it with many short strokes. The
habit is a bad one and should be stopped as soon as noticed.
Learn to wipe the top edge with only two strokes, the bottom
edge with not more than four, the body of the joint with
four, and one cross wipe to finish. This joint should be
finished as symmetrically as possible and wiped while the
solder is hot.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>
<h3>RUN HELD VERTICALLY</h3>

<p>When the vertical branch has been conquered and the
wiper can get a good joint every time it is tried, the pipe
can be changed to a different position. The run is placed
in a vertical position and the branch horizontally to the
left. The catch pan is put under the end of the pipe.
Follow the same directions for supporting this joint as were
given under the <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>-in. branch placed in a similar position.
The wiping of this joint is so nearly like the preceding
branch joints that I will not give any instructions at all.
This joint is finished at the same point that the other branch
joints are finished. However, there are one or two matters
that should be kept in mind. Some of the small matters
are often overlooked and should be called to mind occasionally.
Do not allow the solder to accumulate in the pan.
If the cloths are burned, they should be turned, or new ones
made. If the paper has started to come off from the pipe,
new paper should be put on at once. Test the solder occasionally
and see that it does not get too hot. Upon completion
of the joint in this position, the branch joint in its
various positions is finished. The beginner has found out
while wiping these various joints a number of points that
were not mentioned in my description. No amount of
detailed description will make a good joint wiper. Patience
and practice are as important in joint wiping as good preparation
and good solder.</p>

<h3>BIB</h3>

<p>This joint is another brass to lead, and is the last single
joint to be wiped in this course of joint wiping.</p>

<p><b>Materials Needed.</b>&mdash;The materials required for this
joint are as follows: 10 inches of <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>-inch extra strong lead
pipe; one <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch brass sink bib for lead pipe; one pot of
solder, paste and paper, <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>
and <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> solder, <!--Page 59: changed typo "." to ","--> catch pan, and
supports.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 327px;">
<a name="Fig_31" id="Fig_31"></a><a href="images/fig31.gif"><img src="images/fig31tn.gif" width="327" height="300" class="plain" alt="Fig. 31." title="Fig. 31." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 31.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Tools Required.</b>&mdash;The tools
required for this job are the
saw, rasp, tap borer, bending
irons, file, ladle, wiping cloths,
shave hook, knife and rule,
soldering iron.</p>

<p><b>Preparation.</b>&mdash;To prepare
the lead pipe after cutting
from the coil and squaring
the ends with the rasp is very similar to the <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>-inch branch
joint. The center of the pipe is marked and a hole is made
in it with the tap borer large enough to admit the bending
irons. The hole is enlarged with the irons. A good substantial
collar is made around the hole to hold the bib in
place. One and one-eighth inches are marked off on each
side of the branch and an easy curve connects the two.
The paper is then cut out and pasted on the pipe after it
has been scraped with the shave hook.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig_32" id="Fig_32"></a><a href="images/fig32.gif"><img src="images/fig32tn.gif" width="300" height="299" class="plain" alt="Fig. 32.--Bib." title="Fig. 32.&mdash;Bib." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 32.&mdash;Bib.</span>
</div>

<p>The end of the brass bib is filed bright and tinned with
the soldering iron and <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> and <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> solder. Before the tinning
is done, paper is put on the brass, leaving only 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> inches
exposed. The tinning must be thoroughly done, or it will
come off and have to be re-tinned.</p>

<p><b>Supporting.</b>&mdash;The bib is fitted into the lead opening and
the collar is forced against the bib to hold it in place and
prevent any solder from leaking through into the bore of the
pipe. The bib must not extend too far into the lead pipe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
or it will obstruct the flow of water. The lead pipe is
laid on two bricks the same as the round joint. The bib
is laid on an angle of 45&deg; pointing away from the wiper.
Some bricks can be piled up to the right height to hold the
bib in place and a solder strap can be made to hold it
steady. The lead pipe can be
held steady by weighting each
end. The catch pan is now
placed under the joint and everything
is ready for wiping.</p>

<p><b>Wiping.</b>&mdash;When the solder is
hot, getting the heat on the pipe
is started. Solder should be
dropped oftener on the brass bib
than on the lead pipe. It takes
more heat to heat the brass
thoroughly than it does the
lead. If this is followed out, little difficulty will be had in
getting up the heat and in wiping. Use the branch cloth
for wiping and make sure that all edges are perfectly
cleaned before making the final strokes. As this is the
only position that the joint will be wiped in, practice should
be continued until perfect joints can be obtained.</p>

<h3>DRUM TRAP</h3>

<p>The making of the drum trap will bring out the skill of
the beginner. The entire trap is made of lead pipe. The
lead will require a great deal of handling. Therefore,
care must be exercised in all operations to turn the trap out
in a workmanlike manner.</p>

<p><b>Materials Needed.</b>&mdash;The materials needed to complete
this job are: 10 inches of 4-inch 8-pound lead pipe; 18 inches
of 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch light lead pipe; paste and paper, support, solder,
and catch pan.</p>

<p><b>Tools Needed.</b>&mdash;The tools required for this job are:
saw, rasp, bending irons, shave hook, bending spring, tap
borer, dresser, ladle, drift plug, and wiping cloths.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig_33" id="Fig_33"></a><a href="images/fig33.gif"><img src="images/fig33tn.gif" width="500" height="246" class="plain" alt="Fig. 33.--Drum trap." title="Fig. 33.&mdash;Drum trap." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 33.&mdash;Drum trap.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Preparing.</b>&mdash;Take the 10-inch piece of lead pipe and hold
it in one hand, in the other hand take a pine dresser.
Strike the lead pipe with the dresser. The pipe is struck
about 2 inches from the end and is beaten evenly all around.
The pipe is then struck nearer the end until finally the bore
of the pipe is almost closed. This closed end should be
rounding and symmetrical. To get this shape the pipe
must be continually moved and turned. One side must not
be forced in more than the other. If there are any dents
in the pipe or part of the pipe is forced in too much it may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
be driven out as follows: Take an old piece of <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch lead
pipe and round one end of it with a hammer; this can be
used by hitting the inside of the closed end of the drum and
forcing out the dents. The rounded end of the trap is not
quite closed and a hole about <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> inch is left. This opening
is closed by shaping the edges of it with the knife, making
them smooth and beveled. Then a piece of lead is cut out
of some scrap, the same shape as the hole and fitted into
it. The top surface of this fitted piece should be a little
lower than the surface of the pipe. Strike a circle, using
the compasses, the center of the circle being the center of
the inserted piece of lead. The lead inside of this circle is
shaved clean with the shave hook, including the inserted
piece. Paper is then pasted outside of the circle and should
cover entirely the rest of the pipe. The inserted piece is
wiped on the pipe as follows:</p>

<p><b>Wiping End.</b>&mdash;Stand the 4-in. pipe in a pan with the
rounded end of the pipe up. Be sure that the inserted
piece is fitted securely. The solder is now dropped on the
paper and shaved portion of the pipe. Exercise considerable
care not to burn a hole in the pipe. As the hot solder
runs off, catch some of it and draw it back on the joint.
When the solder can be manipulated freely and the pipe is
hot, the joint can be wiped. The cloth is drawn across the
joint, cleaning all the edges with one stroke. The joint
should be shaped to complete the rounding surface of the
pipe. The joint is comparatively easy and will not occupy
much time. As soon as it is wiped, cover the solder with
paper. This will preserve the freshness of the joint until
all wiping is completed.</p>


<h3>PREPARING INLET PIPE</h3>

<p>After the above joint is completed, the 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-in. branch
inlet pipe is prepared and wiped in place. The center of
this branch is marked on the 4-inch pipe and a hole is tapped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
in the pipe, using the tap borer. A hole large enough
to admit the bending irons is made. The hole is enlarged
with the bending irons, bending the lead first <i>up</i>, then <i>back</i>.
A piece of <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch iron pipe can be used as a tool to finish
the opening. The iron pipe is larger in diameter than the
bending irons and leaves a more finished surface. The
opening is made of sufficient size to admit the rasped end
of the 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch pipe. When using the irons to enlarge the
opening in the pipe, be sure not to bruise any part of the
trap. The 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch pipe is now taken. The ends of this
pipe are squared with the rasp. The drift plug is then
driven through the pipe to take out any bruises or flattened
places. The edge of one end is rasped off to fit the opening
made in the 4-inch pipe. The beginner must strive to make
a perfect fit. The accuracy with which these preparations
are made is what helps in a large degree to bring about a
successful job. The next operation is to paper the parts
not to be wiped. The sizes of the joint should be followed
as shown on the sketch. The pipe is first shaved with the
shave hook, after which the paper is pasted on. No paste
is allowed to get on the joint proper. The beginner should
by this time have formed the habit of being neat with his
work. Therefore the getting of paste on the joint surface
shows that he is not as neat or as far advanced as he
should be.</p>

<p><b>Supporting.</b>&mdash;The drum is laid lengthwise on the bench
and blocks are put on each side to keep it from rolling, the
branch uppermost. The 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch pipe is held in position
the same way as the vertical branch was held. The catch
pan is put under the drum to catch the surplus solder.</p>

<p><b>Wiping.</b>&mdash;Splash the solder on the branch pipe, also on
the drum. The burning through of the drum is an easy
matter. Therefore do not keep dropping the solder on one
place, but keep the ladle moving continually. With the
catch cloth draw the solder up on the branch covering the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
top edge of the prepared surface. Splashing the solder on
this top edge melts the solder already on and allows it to
run down on the 4-inch pipe where it is caught with the
cloth and again brought up on the top edge of the branch.
When the solder works freely all around the joint, the top
edge is wiped clean and even. Then any surplus solder is
wiped off. The bottom edge is next wiped clean, after
which the body of the joint is wiped into shape, together
with both edges. The edges are wiped very thin so that
when the paper is removed the outline of the joint stands out
very distinctly. A thick edge on a joint gives an unworkmanlike
appearance to the work. The joint is finished with
a cross wipe.</p>

<p>The other joints are prepared and wiped the same as the
one just completed. The 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch branch connection
taken out of the bottom of the trap is bent. As this is the
first time it has been necessary to bend lead pipe in these
jobs, I will cover this operation in detail. The pipe is
first straightened and the drift plug driven through it. The
pipe is marked where the bend is to be made. The bending
spring, size 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> inches, is put into the pipe, the center of
the spring coming about where the bend is to be made.
The pipe is then heated where it was marked to be bent.
The proper heat for this pipe is just so that the hand cannot
stand being laid against it. The pipe is held in the hands
and on the end nearest the heat is hit against the floor at an
angle. The pipe, with the first blow, will start to bend.
With a few more strokes the desired bend will be obtained.
The bending spring can now be pulled out. Put a little
water in the pipe, then put one end of the spring in the
vise, twist the pipe, and the spring will come out when
the pipe is pulled away from it. The bending spring
holds the pipe cylindrical while it is being bent. Without
the spring, the pipe would be badly crushed at the bend
and rendered almost unfit for service. Another good way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to bend pipe is to plug one end and fill the pipe full of sand,
then plug the open end. The pipe is then heated where the
bend is to be made. The pipe can then be bent over the
knee. When all the joints are wiped, the paper should be
taken off and the lead cleaned with sand and water. The
trap is now complete except the brass clean-out to be soldered
on the top. The inside of the trap should not have
any rough edges or drops of solder in it.</p>

</div></div>

<p>There are two other drum traps to be made. The
materials needed are the same as for the above trap except
for 18 inches more of 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch lead pipe. The support,
preparation, and wiping are the same. The beginner by
this time should feel very well acquainted with lead and
solder. Therefore, the details of these two drum traps
can be left for the beginner to work out for himself. The
sketches are very distinct and readable and will be of considerable
assistance. The beginner should make these
traps.</p>

<h3>THE PRACTICAL USE OF THE PRECEDING EXERCISES</h3>

<p>In the foregoing exercises, I have confined myself to the
actual work of making the various joints. Now I will
explain the practical use of them.</p>

<p><b>Soldering Iron.</b>&mdash;The soldering iron is a tool that is used
in work that requires heat to fuse solder and the parts to
be united. Every plumber should have at least two irons
in his kit.</p>

<p><b>The Cup Joint.</b>&mdash;While the cup joint is not employed to
any great extent in modern plumbing, yet it has its use in
the installation of some fixtures. Lavatories, bath and
toilets are sometimes connected with a short piece of lead on
the supply. The tail pieces on the faucets can be soldered
on the lead by means of a cup joint. A cup joint well made
with a deep cup and the solder well fused is as strong as a
wiped joint in a place of this kind. The evil of the cup
joint is that some mechanics will only fuse the surface and
leave the deep cup only filled with solder and not fused.
This makes a tight joint, but extremely weak. On tin-lined
pipe and block-tin pipe the cup joint is commonly
used. When making a cup joint on block-tin pipe the soldering
iron must not touch the pipe and fine solder should
be used. When tin-lined pipe is being soldered, the tin
lining must not be melted.</p>

<p><b>Overcast Joint.</b>&mdash;The overcast joint is not commonly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
used, but when there is considerable lead work to do the
plumber finds it very handy in places where a wiped joint
would take up too much room. We use it for an exercise
for the reason that it teaches the beginner very rapidly
the use and control of the soldering iron.</p>

<p><b>Flat Seams.</b>&mdash;These seams are used in the construction
of roof flashers, tanks (<a href="#Sec_33">Sec. 33</a>, Chapter XVIII) and lead
safe wastes (<a href="#Sec_27">Sec. 27</a>, plumbing code). A hatchet iron is
sometimes used on these seams.</p>

<p><b>Wiping Cloths.</b>&mdash;The wiping cloths made of whalebone
ticking make good, serviceable, and lasting cloths. Oil
only should be used to break the cloth in. Moleskin cloths
are very good, but they are very hard to get and cost considerably
more. A plumber should always keep a good
supply of ticking cloths on hand. The cloths are used
only for wiping.</p>

<p><b><span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch Round Joint.</b>&mdash;This joint is the one most often
required in actual practice. It serves to connect two pieces
of lead pipe of the same or different diameters. It is also
used to connect lead and other materials of which pipe is
made. The workman, when he gets out on the job, finds
that his work cannot be supported for wiping in such an
easy and convenient position as illustrated in the exercises.
It will be necessary to wipe the joint at almost every conceivable
angle and position. The workman must employ
his ingenuity to overcome any difficulties that may arise.
Any draught of air should be avoided as it will make the
solder cool quickly.</p>

<p><b>2-inch Brass Ferrule.</b>&mdash;When it is found necessary to
connect cast-iron and lead pipe, it is done by means of a
brass ferrule wiped on the lead pipe. This joint is a very
common joint and is found on sink, tray, and bath connections,
as well as in many other connections that have lead
and cast-iron pipes for wastes.</p>

<p><b>4-inch Brass Ferrule.</b>&mdash;The 4-inch brass ferrule wiped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
on lead pipe is found under almost every closet. There is
generally a piece of lead connecting the toilet with the soil
pipe. Therefore, a brass ferrule is wiped on the lead and
the ferrule connected with the soil pipe. This joint is also
found on rain leader connections near the roof, connecting
the gutter with the rain leader stack.</p>

<p><b>Stop Cock.</b>&mdash;When a shut-off is required in a line of lead
water pipe, these joints are used. Where it is necessary to
joint lead and brass, this joint is required. The art of heat
control over the lead and the brass is the essential point in
these joints.</p>

<p><b>Branch Joints <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> and <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> Inches.</b>&mdash;Where it is found necessary
to take a branch from a water pipe, this joint is used at
the connection. In practice, this joint may have to be
wiped in positions that are rather difficult to reach, so the
wiping of joints in the positions called for in the exercises
is exceedingly good practice.</p>

<p><b>Branch Joints 1&frac12; Inches.</b>&mdash;These joints are very common
and are found on waste and vent pipes. They are also found
on urinal flush-pipe connections where the branch often is
brass and the run lead.</p>

<p><b>Bib.</b>&mdash;When lead supplies are run directly to the bib on a
sink, this joint is necessary. It becomes necessary to wipe
in a piece of brass for a brass-pipe connection from a lead
pipe, in which case this joint is called for.</p>

<p><b>The Drum Trap.</b>&mdash;The drum trap is used under sinks,
baths, showers, and trays.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Laying Terra-cotta and Making Connections to<br />
Public Sewers. Water Connections To<br />
Mains in Streets</span></h3>


<h3>TERRA-COTTA PIPE</h3>

<p>One of the first pieces of work which a plumber is called
upon to do, when building operations commence, is to run
in the terra-cotta sewer from the street sewer into the
foundation wall.</p>

<div class="figs">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 441px;">
<a name="Fig_35" id="Fig_35"></a><a href="images/fig35.gif"><img src="images/fig35tn.gif" width="441" height="400" class="plain" alt="Fig. 35.--Connection of house sewer to main sewer." title="Fig. 35.&mdash;Connection of house sewer to main sewer." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 35.&mdash;Connection of house sewer to main sewer.</span>
</div></div>

<p>When the street sewer is laid, Y-branches are left every
few feet. A record of the branches and their distance from
the manhole is kept generally in the Department of Sewers
or Public Works. Therefore, the exact measurement of
any branch can be obtained and the branch found by digging
down to the depth of the sewer. A branch should be chosen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
so that the pipe can be laid with a pitch, the same way as the
main sewer pitches. This can be done by getting the
measurements of two of these branches and choosing the
one that will serve best. When there is a brick sewer in
the street and no branches left out, the sewer must be tapped
wherever the house sewer requires it (see <a href="#Fig_35">Fig. 35</a>).</p>

<p><b>Digging Trenches.</b>&mdash;After the measurements and location
of the house sewer and sewer branches are properly
located, the digging of the trench is started. The methods
employed to dig the trench vary according to the nature of
the ground, that is, whether it is sand, rock, or wet ground.
A line should be struck from sewer to foundation wall to
insure a straight trench.</p>

<div class="figs">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig_36" id="Fig_36"></a><a href="images/fig36.gif"><img src="images/fig36tn.gif" width="500" height="286" class="plain" alt="Fig. 36.--Laying of plank for trench dug in sandy ground." title="Fig. 36.&mdash;Laying of plank for trench dug in sandy ground." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 36.&mdash;Laying of plank for trench dug in sandy ground.</span>
</div></div>

<p><b>Sandy Ground.</b>&mdash;If the ground is sandy, the sides of the
trench will have to be sheathed or planked and the planks
braced so as to prevent the bank caving in. As the trench
is dug deeper, the planks are driven down. When the
trench is very deep, a second row of planking is necessary.
The planks must be kept well down to the bottom of the
trench and close together, otherwise the sand will run in.
It is well to test the planking as progress is made by tamping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the sand on the bank side of the planks.</p>

<p><b>Gravel.</b>&mdash;Where the ground is mostly gravel and well
packed, the above method of planking is unnecessary. The
bank should have a few stringers and braces to support it.
When only a few planks are used the term "corduroy the
bank" is used (see <a href="#Fig_37">Fig. 37</a>).</p>

<div class="figs">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig_37" id="Fig_37"></a><a href="images/fig37.gif"><img src="images/fig37tn.gif" width="500" height="319" class="plain" alt="Fig. 37.--Arrangement of plank for gravel." title="Fig. 37.&mdash;Arrangement of plank for gravel." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 37.&mdash;Arrangement of plank for gravel.</span>
</div></div>

<p><b>Rock.</b>&mdash;Where rock is encountered, blasting is resorted
to. The plumber should not attempt to handle a job requiring
the use of powder. It is dangerous in the hands
of a person not used to handling it and the work should be
sublet.</p>

<p>A sketch of the two methods above for planking trenches
is given and a little study will make them clear.</p>


<h3>LAYING OF PIPE</h3>

<p>The pipe should be laid on the bottom of the trench to a
pitch of at least <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> inch per foot fall. In laying, the
start should be made at the street sewer with hubs of pipe
toward the building. The trench should be dug within
a few inches of the bottom of the pipe, then as the pipe is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
laid the exact depth is dug out, the surplus dirt being thrown
on the pipe already laid. The body length of pipe should
be on solid foundation. A space dug out for each hub as
shown in <a href="#Fig_38">Fig. 38</a> allows for this, also allows for the proper
cementing of joints. To get the proper pitch of pipe, take
for example <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> inch per foot, a level 2 feet long with a
piece of wood or metal on one end <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> inch thick will answer.
The end with the <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch piece on should be on the lower
hub and the other end resting on the hub of the pipe about
to be put in place. When the bubble shows level, then the
pipe has the <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>-inch fall per foot. If a tile trap is used,
it should be laid level, otherwise the seal will be weakened
or entirely broken.</p>

<div class="figs">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig_38" id="Fig_38"></a><a href="images/fig38.gif"><img src="images/fig38tn.gif" width="500" height="161" class="plain" alt="Fig. 38.--Laying terra-cotta pipe." title="Fig. 38.&mdash;Laying terra-cotta pipe." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 38.&mdash;Laying terra-cotta pipe.</span>
</div></div>

<p><b>Cutting.</b>&mdash;The cutting of tile is not difficult, but must be
done carefully or the pipe will crack or a piece will be broken
out, thus making the pipe worthless. To cut tile or terra-cotta
pipe, stand the pipe on end with the hub down, fill the
pipe with sand to the point of cutting. With a sharp chisel
and hammer cut around the pipe two or three times and the
pipe will crack around practically straight.</p>

<p><b>Cementing.</b>&mdash;If the pipe is free from cracks, the only
possible way roots can get into the inside of terra-cotta
pipe is through the cement joint. There are two ways of
making these joints. Both ways are explained below and
are used today on terra-cotta work.</p>

<ol class="lsoff">
<li>
<p><i>First.</i>&mdash;The bottom of the hub of pipe in place is filled
with cement and the straight end of the next piece of pipe is
laid in place, then more cement is placed into the hub until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the space between the hub and the pipe is filled. In a
trench, a trowel is rather unhandy to work with, while the
hands can be used to better advantage. The cement can
be forced into place with the hands and then surfaced with
a trowel. The rest of the operation is to swab out the
inside joint to remove any cement that perchance was
forced through the joint (see <a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39</a>). The cement used
should be <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> cement and <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> clean sharp sand.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i>&mdash;Half of the space between the hub and the pipe
is first packed with oakum and then the other half filled
with cement of the same proportions as that used above.</p>
</li></ol>

<div class="figs">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig_39" id="Fig_39"></a><a href="images/fig39.gif"><img src="images/fig39tn.gif" width="500" height="82" class="plain" alt="Fig. 39.--Showing use of the swab." title="Fig. 39.&mdash;Showing use of the swab." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 39.&mdash;Showing use of the swab.</span>
</div></div>

<h3>LAYING PIPE IN TUNNELS</h3>

<div class="figs">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig_40" id="Fig_40"></a><a href="images/fig40.gif"><img src="images/fig40tn.gif" width="500" height="176" class="plain" alt="Fig. 40.--Pushing pipe through tunnel." title="Fig. 40.&mdash;Pushing pipe through tunnel." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 40.&mdash;Pushing pipe through tunnel.</span>
</div></div>

<p>If the pipe must be run through a tunnel and there are
perhaps three or four joints that cannot be reached, they
should be put into place as follows: The pipe should be
laid in the trench from the sewer in the street as far as the
tunnel, then start at the other end of the tunnel. Lay the
first piece of pipe on a board, lengthwise with the board,
nail two cleats in the shape of a &gt; (<a href="#Fig_40">Fig. 40</a>) for the pipe to
rest in; push this pipe and board into the tunnel and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
cement into its hub a second piece; push the two pieces in
2 feet, cement a third length into the second piece and push
the three pieces along 2 feet. A workman can be on the
sewer side of the tunnel and receive the end of the pipe as
it is pushed through the tunnel, and steer the pipe into the
hub. The joints in the tunnel will not be as secure as those
outside. This explains how pipe is run through a tunnel.</p>

<p><b>Connecting.</b>&mdash;The proper method of connecting the house
sewer with the street sewer is shown in <a href="#Fig_35">Fig. 35</a>. The connection
should be made above the spring of the arch. The
pipe should extend well into the sewer so the sewage will
discharge into water and not drop on sides.</p>

<p><b>Inserting.</b>&mdash;To insert a tee in a line of pipe already laid,
pursue the following method (see <a href="#Fig_41">Fig. 41</a>): Cut or break
out one joint, preserve the bottom of the hub of pipe that
is in. Cut away the top of the hub on the pipe to be inserted,
then place the pipe in position and turn around
until the part of the hub on the piece inserted is on the
bottom. The bottom part of the pipes now will have a
hub to receive the cement. The top part will have to be
cemented carefully, as it is within easy access. This can
be done without difficulty.</p>

<div class="figs">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig_41" id="Fig_41"></a><a href="images/fig41.gif"><img src="images/fig41tn.gif" width="500" height="197" class="plain" alt="Fig. 41.--Inserting length of pipe." title="Fig. 41.&mdash;Inserting length of pipe." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 41.&mdash;Inserting length of pipe.</span>
</div></div>

<p>While laying the pipe a stopper is used to prevent the
sewer gases and foul odors from escaping. This stopper
sometimes is of tile, sometimes a plug of paper or burlap.
This stopper is sometimes cemented in by inexperienced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
men and the trouble created can only be guessed at. If a
stopper is used, the workman must see that it is taken out.</p>

<p><b>Refilling.</b>&mdash;After the pipe is laid and cemented, it should
be covered and allowed to stand 24 hours to give the cement
time to harden. The dirt should then be thrown in and
settled by means of a tamper or by flooding with water.
The planks should not be taken out until the trench is well
filled. To pull the plank, a chain or shoe and lever will
have to be used. Where the tunnels are, dirt will have to
be rammed in with a long rammer, care being taken not to
disturb the pipe. If the refill is not well rammed and
tamped, the trench will settle and cause a bad depression
in the street surface.</p>

<p><b>Terra-cotta Pipe.</b>&mdash;Terra-cotta pipe should be straight,
free from fire cracks, and salt-glazed. The inside of the
hub and outside of the plain end should not be glazed. This
allows the cement to take hold.</p>

<p>Terra-cotta pipe should not be permitted in filled-in
ground.</p>

<p>Roots of trees find their way into the pipe through cracks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
or cement joints. When the roots get inside of the pipe
they grow until the pipe is stopped up. As the roots cannot
be forced or wired out, the sewer must be relaid. The
writer has seen a solid mass of roots 10 feet long taken out
of a tile sewer.</p>

<p>In case terra-cotta is laid in filled-in ground, there is only
one way to insure the pipe from breaking. The pipe should
be laid on planks. Then, if the ground settles, the pipe
will not be broken.</p>


<h3>WATER CONNECTION AND SERVICE</h3>

<p><b>Tapping Main.</b>&mdash;The water service for a building is put
in at the same time as the sewer is connected and run into
the house. For a 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>-service pipe a <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch tap is furnished.
The water company taps the main, at the expense of the
plumber, and inserts a corporation cock.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 42.&mdash;Showing water main and sewer in same ditch.</span>
</div></div>

<p><b>Digging Trench.</b>&mdash;The trench for the water main should
be dug at least 4<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> feet deep or below frost level and the
trench should be kept straight. When the sewer is put in
at the same time, one side of the sewer trench can be cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
out after it is filled up to the level of the water main. The
water pipe can then be laid on this shelf at least 2 feet
away from the original trench of sewer. Sometimes the
surface of the ground must not be disturbed. In this
case small holes are dug and the pipe is pushed through or
driven through under that portion not dug. These places
are often tunnelled (see <a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a>).</p>

<p>In digging in city streets, care should be taken not to
destroy any of the numerous pipes encountered.</p>


<h3>LAYING PIPE</h3>

<p>The trench should be dug straight out from the house so
the pipe can be laid and the main tapped straight out from
the building. The water companies keep a record of these
taps so that in case of trouble the street can be opened and
the water shut off. In laying the water service, the pipe
from the curb to the main should be laid first. This takes
in all the pipe in the street. At the main there is a shut-off
in the tap. Another stop with T or wheel handle must
be placed just inside the curb line. This is called a curb
cock (see <a href="#Fig_43">Fig. 43</a>). One trench either outside or inside of the
curb should be at least 15 feet long so that a full length of
pipe can be laid in the trench. It is generally impossible to
open a trench the full length the pipe is to be run. A trench
10 feet long is dug, then 8 feet left, and another 10- or 8-foot
trench is dug and the two are connected with a small tunnel
and pipe pushed through. When the pipe has been put in
place between the curb and main, the water is turned on and
the pipe flushed out. The valve at the curb should now be
shut off, and if there are any leaks they will show. The
street part is now ready to fill in. At this point <a href="#Fig_43">Fig. 43</a>
should be studied. Note the piece of lead attached to the
pipe and corporation cock. This piece of lead should be
extra heavy and always laid in place the shape of the letter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
S or goose neck. In case the street should settle, this piece
of lead will allow for it. These "lead connections" or
"goose necks" are made as follows: 3 ft. of <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> lead pipe;
1-inch brass solder nipple (wiped on); one brass corporation
cock coupling (wiped on).</p>

<p><b>Laying Pipe.</b>&mdash;This lead connection can be screwed on
the pipe after the pipe is laid, then bent and coupled on
the main with the coupling.</p>

<div class="figs">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 43.&mdash;Water main from street to foundation wall.</span>
</div></div>

<p>After the pipe has been tested as far as the curb, the
trench in the street can be filled as described later. The
pipe from the curb to the building can now be laid. If
necessary to push the pipe through a tunnel, the end of the
pipe should first be capped. Start by screwing a length
in the curb cock. If the other end of the pipe comes in a
tunnel an additional length must be put on before putting
in place so that an end will come in the open trench. When
the building is reached and before the stop cock is put on,
the valve at the curb should be opened full and the pipe
flushed out. The valve can then be put on and water
turned on to test the pipe.</p>

<p><b>Setting Curb Box.</b>&mdash;A cast-iron box, adjustable length,
with cover should extend from the curb cock to the surface.
This makes it possible with a long rod to control<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the water service into the building. To set a curb box
some flat stones should be laid around the curb cock and the
box set on these stones. Then the space around the box
and pipe should be closed in with brick or other covering
to keep the sand from washing in on the curb cock. The
box should be adjusted for height and then held in place
by placing the curb key rod in place and holding the rod
and box while the trench is filled. The refill should be
tamped evenly on all sides of the box.</p>

<p><b>Refill.</b>&mdash;In refilling the trench around the corporation
cock and goose neck, the greatest care should be taken.
The writer has seen cases when indifferent workmen have
tossed heavy stones in the ditch and broken off the corporation
cock or destroyed the goose neck. After the pipe is
covered with 18 inches of refill and tunnels have been filled,
water can be run in the trench and will settle the refill.</p>

<p>There are a number of special points concerning water
services and taps at mains that should not be overlooked.
Take for example a water service pipe which must be run
through ground where electricity is escaping under trolley
tracks, around power houses, etc. The electricity will enter
the pipe and wherever it leaves the pipe a hole is burned.
The surface of the pipe in a short time will be full of small
pith marks and will soon leak. A good way to add to the
life of the pipe under these conditions is to make a star
of copper and solder it on to the pipe in the street. Another
piece of copper should be put on the pipe near the building.
The electricity will leave the pipe by way of the points on
the star. This method may not be a cure for electrolysis,
but will add to the life of the pipe. Another method employed
is to put the pipe in the center of a square box, then
fill the box with hot pitch. When this is hardened the
pipe will have a covering that will keep out any moisture
and bar electricity to a marked degree.</p>

<p><b>Materials Used.</b>&mdash;Galvanized steel pipe does not last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
under ground.</p>

<p>Galvanized iron, heavy lead, and brass are used. Wooden
pipes were once used and stood years of service. No service
smaller than 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> should be used.</p>

<p>When the water service pipe passes through the foundation
wall, the pipe should not be built in, but a small arch
should be built over the pipe or a piece of XX cast-iron pipe
can be used as a sleeve (<a href="#Fig_44">Fig. 44</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Installing of French or Sub-soil Drains</span></h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig_45" id="Fig_45"></a><a href="images/fig45.gif"><img src="images/fig45tn.gif" width="300" height="317" class="plain" alt="Fig. 45.--Sub-soil drain." title="Fig. 45.&mdash;Sub-soil drain." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 45.&mdash;Sub-soil drain.</span>
</div>

<p>When a building is erected on a site that is wet or springy,
some means of carrying off the surplus water in the ground
must be provided for, or the basement of the building will
be flooded with water. For the thorough understanding of
the methods employed in laying a drain of this kind, I will
go over it carefully and the beginner can read it and then
study it, and understand just how it is done. A site may
appear to be dry on the surface of the ground and yet be
very wet under the surface. If no information can be had
regarding the site, it is always well
to drain the site if it is on a slope
or near a body of water and on
the water shed of a river or lake.
If a building is a large one and
the foundation goes down very
deep, the site should always be
drained. The drain is laid under
the basement floor and around
the outside of the foundation wall
on a level with or lower than the
basement floor. The value of
draining a building site when the building is first started is
very often overlooked. The cost of the drain will be saved
in a few years as the basement will be free from all excessive
dampness. The expense of installing a sub-soil
after the building is up and in use is great as well as inconvenient.
The drain is called "sub-soil drain" on account
of its location under the ground and on account of its duty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of taking off all surplus water that is underground. With
the surface water taken off by the surface drains and the
sub-soil drained by the sub-soil drains, a wet building site
can be made practically dry (see <a href="#Fig_45">Fig. 45</a>).</p>

<p><b>Materials Used in Sub-soil Construction.</b>&mdash;The object
of the drain is to collect water and carry it away from the
building by means of pipes. Terra-cotta pipes, with or
without hubs, are used. Perforated tile pipe is sometimes
used. This pipe is unglazed terra-cotta pipe with 1-inch
holes in the sides about 3 or 4 inches from the center.
These holes allow the surplus water to enter the bore of the
pipe and thus be carried off beyond the building site.</p>

<p>When the sub-soil of a small building needs draining,
the trenches made for the house drain and its branches are
used as a drain in the following manner: The trenches are
dug deeper than is required for the house drain. The
trenches are then filled to the correct level with broken
stones. There is space between these stones for the water
to find passage to a point away from the building. When
this method is employed, some provision must be made to
prevent the house drain from settling. When locating the
drain, we must consider approximately the amount of water
that is likely to be in the soil and required to be carried off.
If there is considerable water, the pipes should extend all
around the outside of the building foundation wall, also
a main pipe running under the cellar bottom with six
branches, three branches on each side.</p>

<p>If there is not a great deal of surplus water in the soil, the
drain around the outside of the foundation wall should be
put in and one drain line running through the basement
will be sufficient.</p>

<p><b>Laying the Pipe.</b>&mdash;The drain pipe should be handled with
care, for it is easily broken. The trench should be laid out
and dug, then the pipe can be laid in it with a grade toward
the outlet or discharge. If pipes with a hub on one end are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
used, the hub should not be cemented. A little oakum
is packed in the hub to steady the pipe and keep sand out,
the bottom of joint is cemented, a piece of tar paper can be
laid over the top of the joint to keep the sand out. With
joints made this way, the water can find its way to the bore
of the pipe and yet the sand will be kept out of the pipe.
As soon as the water gets into the bore of the pipe it has a
clear passageway to some discharge point away from the
building. If tile pipes without any hubs are used, some
covering should be put around the joint to keep out the sand
and still allow the water to find its way into the pipes.</p>

<p><b>Discharge of Sub-soil Drain.</b>&mdash;The water that accumulates
in a sub-soil drain must be carried off to some point
away from the building. As the pipes are generally under
the cellar bottom and under the house drain, it is very
evident that this drain cannot discharge into the house
drain sewer, directly. If the building site is on a hill, the
drain can be carried out and discharged on the surface at
a point that is somewhat lower than the level of the pipe
under the building. Where this cannot be done, it will be
necessary to have the different lines of pipes discharge into
a pit. The water is accumulated in this pit until it is
filled, then it will automatically empty itself as later
explained.</p>

<p><b>Pit Construction.</b>&mdash;The pit for the sub-soil water is
constructed of cement. A pit 2 feet square or 2 feet in
diameter and 3 feet deep will answer all requirements. A
pit of this depth will allow a pitch for all lines of pipe, and
is large enough for ordinary installations. The pit is built
up to the surface of the cemented floor of the basement
and covered with a removable iron cover.</p>

<p><b>Cellar Drainer or Pump.</b>&mdash;A cellar drainer is employed
to empty the above-mentioned pit. The cellar drainer
works automatically. When the pit is filled with water,
the drainer operates and empties the pit and discharges<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the water into a sink or open sewer connection. When the
pit is emptied, the drainer shuts off. The cellar drainer
is operated by water pressure. When the valve is opened,
a small jet of water is discharged into a larger pipe. The
velocity of this small jet of water creates a suction and
carries along with it some of the water in the pit. This
suction continues until the tank is empty. There should
always be a strainer on the suction pipe, also on the supply
pipe, to prevent any particles of dirt getting into the valve.
The pipes leading to and from the drainer should empty into
an open sink where it can be seen. There is a possibility
of the drainer valve leaking and then the water pressure
will leak through it, causing a waste of water. If this leakage
can be seen where it discharges, then the trouble can be
rectified. The cellar drainer is connected directly with the
water pressure and should have a valve close to the connection
to control the supply.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Storm and Sanitary Drainage with Sewage Disposal<br />
in View</span></h3>

<p>The accompanying drawing of storm and sanitary drains
should be studied in detail by the reader. The location of
each trap and fitting should be studied carefully and the
reason that it is put in that particular place should be
thoroughly understood. Below, each plan has been taken
and gone over in detail, bringing out the reasons for fittings
and traps, also the arrangement of the piping.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 271px;">
<a name="Fig_46" id="Fig_46"></a><a href="images/fig46.gif"><img src="images/fig46tn.gif" width="272" height="450" class="plain" alt="Fig. 46." title="Fig. 46." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 46.</span>
</div>

<p>The first thing to note in <a href="#Fig_46">Fig. 46</a> is the number and kinds
of fixtures to be drained. There is in the basement a set
of three-part wash trays. This will require
a 2-inch waste and a 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch
vent. There is in the drawing a 2-inch
waste extending to the fixtures above.
On the same line is a rain leader with
a trap showing also a 4-inch floor drain.
There are two 4-inch rain leaders on the
opposite corners of the plan, in the rear
of the building. There is a 4-inch soil
stack for fixtures above and a 4-inch soil
stack in the basement on the same line
for a basement toilet. On the front
there are rain leaders in each corner.
These will be connected outside of the house trap (this
feature should be noted). The outlets that are to discharge
into the house drain are as follows:</p>

<div class="indent">
<ul class="lsoff">
<li>Two 4-inch rain leaders.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></li>
<li>One 2-inch sink waste.</li>
<li>One 2-inch wash tray waste.</li>
<li>One 4-inch floor drain.</li>
<li>One 4-inch soil pipe.</li>
<li>One 4-inch closet connection.</li>
<li>Two 4-inch front rain leaders to discharge into house
sewer.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>If we were to install this job, we would first locate each
pipe that enters the house drain. The lowest outlet would
be particularly noted, in this case the 4-inch floor drain.
From this drain we must make sure that at least <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> inch
to the foot fall is secured. We must then locate the house
sewer where it enters the foundation wall, then the work can
be started. I will not attempt to list the material that is
necessary for this work, at this time. With all the material
at hand the house drain is started. All of this work is
installed under the ground, therefore trenches must be
dug for all the piping. The plumber must lay these trenches
out and in doing so he must have in mind all connections
and the fittings he can use so that the trenches can be dug
at the right angle. The trenches must be dug allowing a
pitch for the pipe. The height of the cellar is 8 feet below
the joists. A stick is cut 8 feet long which can be used to
get the trenches below the cement floor at the right depth.
After the digging is completed, the house trap, which is a
6-inch running trap, is caulked into a length of 6-inch
cast-iron pipe. This piece of pipe is pushed out toward
the sewer bringing the trap near the foundation wall, on
the inside. The fittings and traps and pipe are caulked
in place as fast as possible. When possible, the joints are
caulked outside of the trench in an upright position.
There are a number of different ways to caulk this pipe
together, and to make it clear to the beginner just how it
is done the following exercise is suggested. This job
brings in the caulking of pipes, traps, and fittings in various<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
positions. Two or three can work on this job together.
<a href="#Fig_47">Fig. 47</a> shows how the pipe and fittings are put together,
which needs no further explanation. Therefore, we will
go over in detail only the caulking of the joints in the various
positions.</p>

<div class="figs">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig_47" id="Fig_47"></a><a href="images/fig47.gif"><img src="images/fig47tn.gif" width="300" height="336" class="plain" alt="Fig. 47." title="Fig. 47." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 47.</span>
</div></div>

<p><b>Material Needed.</b>&mdash;One length of 4-inch extra heavy
cast-iron pipe, single hub; two lengths of 4-inch extra
heavy cast-iron pipe, double hub; one running trap, one
full Y, one 4-inch <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> bend; two 4-inch clean-out screws with
iron body; one 4-inch vent cap; one 4-inch <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> bend; 30
pounds of block lead; 2 pounds of oakum.</p>

<p><b>Tools Required.</b>&mdash;Ladle, asbestos pourer, hammer, cold
chisel, yarning iron, two caulking irons, furnace and pot.</p>

<p>The beginner should start at the trap and caulk the joints
with the trap held in place. The cold chisel should be
sharp as it is used to cut the cast-iron pipe.</p>

<p>To caulk the straight end of cast-iron pipe into the hub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
end and make a water-tight joint when the pipe is in a
vertical position, the spigot end of the pipe is entered into
the hub end of another piece. A wad of oakum is taken
and forced into the hub with the yarning iron. This piece
of oakum is forced to the bottom of the hub, then another
piece is put in. The oakum is set and packed by using the
yarning iron and hammer. The hub is half filled with
oakum. The oakum is forced tight enough to make a
water-tight joint. If the oakum used comes in a bale,
pieces of it will have to be taken and rolled into long ropes
about 18 inches long, the thickness of the rope corresponding
with the space between the hub and the pipe. If
rope oakum is used, the strands of the rope can be used.
After the oakum is well packed into place and the pipe is
lined up and made straight, molten lead is poured in and
the hub filled. When the lead has cooled, set the lead with
the caulking tool and hammer, making one blow on each
side of the joint. This sets the lead evenly on every side.
If there is any surplus lead, it can now be cut off, using
the hammer and cold chisel. The caulking iron is again
taken and the lead next to the pipe is tamped, striking the
iron with the hammer at an angle to drive the lead against
the pipe. After this has been done all around, the caulking
iron is held in such a position that the lead around the
hub will receive the force of the blow. After this has been
done, the center of the lead is caulked and the joint should
be tight. With a little practice, this can be done very
rapidly. The lead should be poured in while it is very
hot. The caulking must not be done by hitting heavy
blows as there is a possibility of splitting the hub and
thereby rendering the joint unfit for use.</p>

<p><b>Caulking Joint in Horizontal Position.</b>&mdash;It is necessary
in a great many cases to caulk a joint in a position where
the lead would run out of the joint unless provision were
made to hold it in. To caulk a joint in a position of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
kind, the pipe is lined up and secured, then the oakum is put
in and forced to the bottom of the hub. Then a joint runner,
which is an asbestos rope about 2 feet long and about
1 inch in diameter, is fitted around the pipe and forced
against the hub where it is clamped by means of an attached
clamp. The clamp is put on the top of the pipe and so
arranged that a channel will be left in a V shape. This
channel allows the hot lead to run between the asbestos
runner and the hub. When the lead has had a chance to
cool, the asbestos runner is taken off. Where the clamp
was, there will be a triangular piece of lead sticking out
beyond the face of the hub. This piece has to be cut off,
but no attempt should be made to do so until it has been
caulked in place and well set; also the rest of the lead should
be set. Then the cold chisel can be used and this extra
piece of lead taken off. The caulking of the lead in this
position is the same as in the previous position and should
be carried out closely. The beginner should understand
that it is necessary to have not only the joints tight so
that running water will not leak out of them, but that
the joints must stand a water test. The testing of soil
stacks is explained under another heading. The lines of
cast-iron pipe depend to a considerable extent upon these
joints to make the whole line rigid.</p>

<p><b>Caulking of Fittings.</b>&mdash;The caulking of fittings, while
done the same as a straight pipe, is far more difficult. The
improper making of these joints is the cause of many
leaks. A long sweep fitting is caulked without a great
deal of difficulty. If a short bend fitting is used, the matter
of caulking is difficult. The fitting is so short that it is
almost impossible to get a caulking iron into the throat.
The mechanics will have to work at the throat from each
side until this part has been sufficiently caulked. I call
attention to this point, for I know it to be a failure in a
large number of jobs when it comes to put the test on. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
order to caulk the fittings, they must be put in their exact
location and positions before the lead is poured in, for after
the lead is once in the fitting cannot be moved. When
there is a series of fittings on a line, their positions in relation
to each other must be considered before the lead is
poured.</p>

<a href="#Fig_46">Fig. 46</a>. Two 4-inch lines run through the cellar, one a
sanitary drain, the other a storm drain. Each 4-inch line
has an intercepting trap. On the sewer side of these traps
the two lines are brought together, beyond which point the
two front rain leaders connect; each of the two front
leaders is trapped separately.</p>

<div class="figs">

<p><a href="#Fig_49">Fig. 49</a> differs from the preceding one in only two points.
First, the two front leaders are brought into the cellar and
connected into the storm drain on the house side of the
intercepting trap. Second, the storm and sanitary drains<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
are connected on the outside of the building.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_50">Fig. 50</a> shows the same fixtures collected into a 4-inch
house drain, and the rain leaders run entirely on the outside
of the building. This plan is a good one as all the storm
water is kept entirely outside the building. If the storm
drains are kept 5 feet away from the cellar walls (see <a href="#plumbing_code">Plumbing
Code</a>) the pipes can be of tile. Another good feature
of this plan is that all the pipes under the cellar are 4-inch.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_51">Fig. 51</a> is similar to <a href="#Fig_46">Fig. 46</a>, the difference being in the
location of the floor drain and the connection of the two
rear rain leaders, into the house drain.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_52">Fig. 52</a> the drains shown take the waste and storm
water from the apartment building, also a building set in
the rear. The leader pipes in this case are trapped on the
outside of the wall. The building in the rear you will
note has a separate fresh air inlet and house trap, and the
house sewer is continued through the front house and
connected into the house drain of the front building, on
the sewer side of the intercepting trap.</p>

<p>These drawings should be studied carefully and the
student should in each case list correctly all of the material
required for the installation of these jobs.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 53.&mdash;Cutting cast-iron pipe.</span>
</div></div>

<p><b>Cutting Cast-iron Pipe.</b>&mdash;To cut cast-iron pipe, a sharp
cold chisel and hammer are needed. The pipe is marked
all around, just where it is to be cut. Then it is laid with
the part of the pipe that is to be cut resting on a block of
wood. A groove is cut with the hammer and chisel around
the pipe. One person can turn the pipe while the other
does the cutting. After a little experience one man can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
cut and roll the pipe alone. This groove is cut deeper and
deeper until the pipe breaks apart. If standard pipe is
being cut, a file is generally resorted to for cutting the
groove. On account of the lightness of the pipe, a hammer
and chisel will crack the pipe lengthwise. When cutting
extra heavy cast-iron pipe, a good heavy blow must be
struck to cause the chisel to cut into the iron. After a
few cuts, the beginner will understand the weight of blow
that must be struck to cut the pipe quickly.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Soil and Waste Pipes and Vents. Tests</span></h3>


<h3>SOIL PIPES</h3>

<p>The term "soil pipes" means pipe that receives the discharge
from water closets. The size of a soil pipe for ordinary
dwellings should be 4 inches.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Size of Soil Pipes</span></h3>
<div class="figs">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="soil pipe sizes">
<tr><td>One   to three  closets&mdash;4-inch XX cast-iron.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Four  to eight  closets&mdash;5-inch XX cast-iron.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Eight to twelve closets&mdash;6-inch XX cast-iron.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>There are cases when 3-inch XX cast-iron pipe is used,
but the practice is not recommended.</p>

<p>The soil pipe should be well supported and held in place.
The connection between soil pipe and closet should be of
lead to allow for any expansion of settling that might take
place.</p>

<p><b>Material of Soil Pipes.</b>&mdash;Soil pipe in common use today
is made of light cast iron, tar-coated, extra heavy cast
iron uncoated and coated, galvanized wrought-iron pipe,
and steel pipe. The best kind to use depends upon the
job and place where it is to be used. All kinds of bends
and fittings can be had in any of the above-mentioned
materials. In choosing the material of the pipe that is
best to use, the following points should be carefully considered.</p>

<ol class="lsoff">
<li><i>First</i>, new work or overhauling.</li>

<li><i>Second</i>, temporary or permanent job.</li>

<li><i>Third</i>, construction of building.</li>

<li><i>Fourth</i>, amount allowed for cost of materials on job.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></li>

<li><i>Fifth</i>, size of job, that is, the number of toilets.</li>

<li><i>Sixth</i>, size of chases and pipe partitions.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Location of Soil Pipe.</b>&mdash;The location of the soil pipe depends
to a great extent upon the location of the toilets.
The soil stack should be located on an inside partition.
The horizontal pipe should not run over expensively
decorated ceilings unless run inside of a trough made of
copper or sheet lead. As far as possible, the pipes should
be confined, to runs short, and the number of bends
reduced.</p>


<h3>SOIL-PIPE FITTINGS</h3>

<p>Soil-pipe fittings can be had from stock almost to suit
the conditions. I will enumerate a few. The names of
these fittings should be familiar to the mechanic so that
when ordering he can give the correct name. <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">16</span>, <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>, <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">6</span>,
<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> bend, sanitary tee, tapped tee, side outlet fitting, return
bend, cross branches, double Y, double TY, traps. The
uses of these cast-iron fittings perhaps are obvious, but
a word about the use of each one will be of service.</p>

<p>The <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> bend is used to change the direction of run of pipe
90&deg;. A long-sweep <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> bend is used on work requiring the
best practice. <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>, <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">16</span>, and <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">6</span> bends are used to change
the direction of pipe 45&deg;, 22<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>&deg;, and 16<span class="above">2</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span>&deg;. Two <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> bends
should be used in preference to one <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> bend where there is
sufficient room. Side outlet <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> bend is used for waste
connection. They can be had with an outlet on either side
of the heel. Their use is not recommended.</p>

<p>Return bends are used on fresh-air inlets. Tees are used
for vents only. Ys are used wherever possible. The use
of a Y-branch together with an <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> bend for a 90&deg; connection
with the main line is always preferable to a TY or, as they
are commonly called, sanitary T. A tapped fitting gets
its name because it is tapped for iron pipe thread. Tapped
fittings are used for venting and should not be used for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
waste unless the tap enters the fitting at an angle of 45&deg;.</p>

<p>These fittings and pipe are joined by first caulking with
oakum and pouring, with one continuous pour, the hub
full of molten metal. When cool, the lead should be set
and then caulked around the pipe and around the hub.</p>

<p>The amount of lead and oakum required for various-sized
joints is as follows:</p>

<div class="figs">
<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="3" summary="joints">

<tr><td>Oakum (ounce)...</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>12</td><td>16</td><td>20</td><td>24</td><td>30</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><b>Rust Joints.</b>&mdash;The plumber is called upon to run cast-iron
pipe in places where lead and oakum will not be of
service for the joints. In cases of this kind, a rust joint is
made. This "rust" is made according to the following
formula:</p>

<ul class="lsoff">
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">1 part flour of sulphur.</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">1 part sal-ammoniac.</span></li>
<li>98 parts iron borings (free from grease).</li>
</ul>

<p>This mixture is made the consistency of cement, using
water to mix thoroughly and bring all parts into contact
with each other. When it hardens, it becomes very hard
and makes a tight joint which overcomes the objections to
lead and oakum joints.</p>


<h3>WROUGHT-IRON AND STEEL PIPE</h3>

<p>This pipe comes in about 18-foot lengths and fittings of
the following makes and shapes, and their use is fully
explained. The lengths of pipe come with a thread on each
end and a coupling screwed on one end. The lengths come
in bundles up to 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inches and in single lengths over that
size. Screw pipe fittings, it will be noted, are called by a
different name than cast-iron ones. The fittings in common
use today are the 90 degree ell, 45, 22, and 16<span class="above">2</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span>. The
Y and TY, tucker fittings, and inverted Ys are used in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
practically the same way as the cast-iron fittings. The 90
degree ell, 45, 22, and 16<span class="above">2</span>&#8260;<span class="below">3</span> are used to change the run of pipe
that many degrees. All 90 degree fittings, ells, and Ts are
tapped to give the pipe a pitch of <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> inch to the foot. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
is better to use two 45 ells to make a 90 bend when it is
possible.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Inverted Y.</b>&mdash;The inverted Y is used in venting to good
advantage. The use of these fittings is illustrated in the
sketches.</p>

<p><b>Waste Pipes.</b>&mdash;Waste pipes are the pipes that run to or
convey the discharge of waste matter to the house drain,
from wash trays, baths, lavatories, sinks, and showers.</p>

<p>The usual size of waste pipes is 2 inches. Waste pipes
are made of the same material as soil pipe. Lead and brass
pipe are also in common use. All exposed waste pipes in
bath and toilet rooms are brass, nickel-plated. The waste
pipes under kitchen sinks and wash trays are either lead or
plain heavy brass. All waste pipes are run with a pitch
towards the house trap and should be properly vented as
explained under venting. The pipes should be easy of access,
with clean-outs in convenient places. The waste
pipes under a tile or cement floor should be covered with
waterproof paper and a metal V-shaped shield over the
entire length. If the waste pipes are over a decorated
ceiling they should be in a copper-lined or lead-lined box.
This box should have a tell-tale pipe running to the open
cellar with the end of the tell-tale pipe left open. If waste
pipes are to take the discharge from sinks in which chemicals
are thrown, either chemical lead or terra-cotta pipe should
be used. If terra-cotta is used, it should have at least
6 inches reinforced concrete around it and the joints of pipe
made of keisilgar.</p>

<p><b>Tell-tale Pipe.</b>&mdash;The tell-tale pipe is a small pipe that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
extends from the trough, pan, or box that is under a line of
pipe or fixtures to the open cellar. When water is seen
running out of this pipe, it shows that a leak exists somewhere
in the line of pipe that is in the box or trough. The
use of this pipe saves the destruction of walls and ceilings.</p>


<h3>VENTS</h3>

<div class="figs">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig_55" id="Fig_55"></a><a href="images/fig55.gif"><img src="images/fig55tn.gif" width="300" height="284" class="plain" alt="Fig. 55.--Circuit vent." title="Fig. 55.&mdash;Circuit vent." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 55.&mdash;Circuit vent.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Vents are the most important pipes in the plumbing
system. Modern plumbing successfully attempts to make
living in crowded and thickly populated districts, as well
as in isolated buildings, free from all unpleasant odors and
annoyances. This could not be accomplished without the
use of vents. Vents relieve all pressure in the system by
furnishing an outlet for the air that is displaced by the waste
discharged from the fixtures. Another of its functions is
to supply air when syphonic action starts, thereby stopping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the action that would break the seal of the trap under
fixtures. The pipe extending from top fixture connection,
up to and through the roof, is called the ventilation pipe.
All vents that do not pass directly through the roof terminate
in this ventilation pipe.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig_56" id="Fig_56"></a><a href="images/fig56.gif"><img src="images/fig56tn.gif" width="300" height="242" class="plain" alt="Fig. 56.--Loop vent." title="Fig. 56.&mdash;Loop vent." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 56.&mdash;Loop vent.</span>
</div>

<p>To explain the use of vents, we might well start in the
basement of a dwelling house. Suppose there is a set of
wash trays in the laundry; the 2-inch trap of these trays
should have a 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>-inch vent pipe
leading from the crown of the
trap up along side of the stack.
On the first floor a 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>-inch pipe
from the crown of the kitchen
sink trap will lead into it. Here
the pipe should be increased to 2
inches. On the second floor the
1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>-inch pipes leading from the
lavatory and bath traps come
into it. The vent stack now extends up into the attic and
connects with the ventilation pipe. In a general way, the
above is an example of venting. The old method of venting
was very complicated and is almost beyond describing
with the pen.</p>

<p>In common use today, there are several kinds of venting,
namely: circuit and loop venting, crown venting, and continuous
venting. The <i>circuit venting</i>, <a href="#Fig_55">Fig. 55</a>, is used in
connection with the installation of closets. Take a row of
toilets in which the waste connection of each closet discharges
into a Y-branch, and there will be a series of
Y-branches. One end of this series of branches discharges
into the main stack while the other end continues and turns
up at least to the height of the top of the closet and then
enters the main vent stack. When this main vent runs
up along side of the main stack and forces the vent pipe connected
to the series of Y-branches to travel back, it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
called a loop vent. This type of vent supplies air to the
complete line of toilets and is very efficient.</p>

<p><b>Continuous venting</b>, <a href="#Fig_57">Figs. 57</a> and <a href="#Fig_58">58</a>, applies more to
fixtures other than toilets. A P-trap is used and enters a T
in the stack. The lower part of the T acts as and connects
with the waste pipe while the upper half is and connects
with the vent pipe. A study of the figures will aid the
reader to understand thoroughly the above explanations.
In continuous venting the waste of the lowest fixture is discharged
into the vent pipe and extended to the main waste
stack where it is connected. This is done to allow any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
rust scales that occasionally drop down the vent pipe, and
render it unfit to perform its duty, to be washed away into
the sewer.</p>

<p><b>Crown venting</b>, <a href="#Fig_59">Fig. 59</a>, is as its name implies, a vent that
is taken from the crown of the trap, thence into the main
vent.</p>

<p>Each one of these methods of venting is used and considered
good practice, provided it is properly installed and
correctly connected with the use of proper fittings.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">House Traps, Fresh-air Connections, Drum Traps,<br />
and Non-syphoning Traps</span></h3>


<p>The <i>house trap</i> is a deep seal trap placed inside the foundation
wall, and intersects the house drain and house sewer.
The trap is placed at this point for a number of reasons:
first, to keep sewer gases from entering the pipes in the
house; second, this location is where the house drain ends.
This trap should have two clean-outs, one on each side of
the seal. The clean-outs should be of extra heavy cast-iron
body with a heavy brass screw cap. The cap should
have a square nut for a wrench to tighten or unscrew the cap.
This cap should be brought up flush with the floor. When a
house trap is being set, it is necessary to set it perfectly
level, otherwise the seal of the trap is weakened and sewer
gases can enter.</p>

<p>Sometimes the trap is located on the house sewer just
outside of the foundation wall. In this case, a pit should
be built large enough for a workman to get down to it to
clean it out when necessary.</p>

<p><i>A mason's trap</i> was formerly used to a considerable
extent, but is very poor practice to use today on modern
work. This trap was built square of brick with a center
partition. The brick soon became foul and the trap would
be better termed a small cesspool than a trap.</p>

<p><b>Points to Remember about House Traps.</b>&mdash;</p>

<h3>FRESH-AIR CONNECTIONS</h3>

<p>The term "fresh-air inlet" is, as its name implies, an inlet
for fresh air. It is placed directly on the house side of
the main trap. The connections made vary considerably.
A few good connections in common use are explained below.</p>

<p>When the trap is in place, one of the clean-outs can be
used for the fresh air. If this is done, a Y-branch should
be placed in the hub of the clean-out. The Y-branch should
be used for the fresh air and the run should be used for a
clean-out.</p>

<p>A Y-fitting can be inserted directly back of the trap and
the branch used for the fresh air. An inverted Y makes a
good fitting to use directly back of the trap. These
branches should be taken off the top of the pipe. The
branch taken off for the fresh-air inlet should not have any
waste discharge into it and should not be used for a drain
pipe of any description.</p>

<p>The fresh-air inlet should run as directly as possible into
the outer air, at least 15 feet from any window. The pipes
terminate in a number of different ways, some with a return
bend, above the ground, some with a cowl cap, some with a
strainer. When necessary to run pipe through the sidewalk,
a box of brick is made with a heavy brass strainer
fitted level with the sidewalk into which the pipe runs. If
the pipe is run into the box on the side a little up from the
bottom, the possibility of becoming stopped up or filled up
is not great. The fresh-air inlet sometimes terminates
above the roof of the building.</p>

<p>Special care should be given this fresh-air inlet as it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
supplies fresh air to the entire system and thus keeps the
pipes in a much better sanitary condition.</p>

<p>Sometimes when the house drain is full of sewage, air is
pushed out of the fresh-air inlet and disagreeable odors are
evident. This is why it should be located as far as possible
from any window. Special care should be taken on the part
of the plumber not to locate the fresh-air inlet nearer than
15 feet to the fresh-air intake of the heating system.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 60.&mdash;Fresh-air inlet.</span>
</div></div>

<p>When the pipe passes through the foundation wall, the
same care should be exercised as with other pipes. That is,
if the pipe is 4 inches, a sleeve 6 inches should be cut in the
wall for the 4-inch pipe to pass through.</p>

<p><b>Points to Remember about Fresh Air.</b>&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<ol class="lsoff">
<li><i>First</i>, never should be smaller than 4 inches.</li>

<li><i>Second</i>, one size smaller than trap.</li>

<li><i>Third</i>, location, directly back of trap.</li>

<li><i>Fourth</i>, leads to outer air.</li>

<li><i>Fifth</i>, keep away from windows and intake of heating system.</li>

<li><i>Sixth</i>, always have end of pipe covered with strainer, cowl, or
return bend.</li>

<li><i>Seventh</i>, make as few bends as possible.</li>

<li><i>Eighth</i>, supplies fresh air to system.</li>
</ol>

<h3>DRUM TRAP</h3>

<p>The use of the drum trap is very handy to the plumber
as well as efficient and practicable when installed. The
trap can be purchased without any outlets
or inlets, so the plumber can put them in
according to the necessary measurements.
The making of these traps with lead is explained
in the chapter on Wiping Joints.
The open end has a brass clean-out screw
on it. When this clean-out screw comes
below the floor, another brass screw cap
and flange is screwed on the floor above
the trap so that the clean-out screw in the
trap is easily accessible.</p>

<div class="figs">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 251px;">
<a name="Fig_61" id="Fig_61"></a><a href="images/fig61.gif"><img src="images/fig61tn.gif" width="251" height="300" class="plain" alt="Fig. 61.--Drum trap." title="Fig. 61.&mdash;Drum trap." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 61.&mdash;Drum trap.</span>
</div></div>

<p>These drum traps are called bath traps as they are used
mostly on bath wastes. They should never be installed
with the clean-out exposed to the sewer side of the trap.
In the best practice, heavy brass drum traps are used.</p>

<p>After years of experimenting to produce a trap that would
not syphon without venting, we find in use today a large
variety of non-syphoning traps. Traps that will hold their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
seal against all practical forms of syphonic action, or other
threatening features, have been made and used and serve
the purpose for which they are intended. Various means
to prevent the breaking of the seal of these traps are employed.
While some depend on a ball or other kind of
valve, others rely on partitions and deflections of various
kinds. All of these perform the functions for which they
are designed, yet the devices employed offer an excellent
obstruction for the free passage of waste; therefore, in
time, these traps become inoperative. It should be borne
in mind that any traps with a mechanical seal or an inside
partition are not considered sanitary. The inside partition
might wear out or be destroyed and thus break the seal
without the knowledge of anyone and allow sewer gas to
enter the room. The mechanical device may also be displaced
or destroyed, leaving the trap without a seal. If the
trap were cleaned out often or examined occasionally,
these traps could be used with a greater degree of safety.
Some of the forms of non-syphon traps in common use are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The <i>Flask Trap</i>, <a href="#Fig_62">Fig. 62</a>. This trap gets its name from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
its shape. There is an inside wall upon which the seal
depends. This trap is like the bag trap, only the two inside
walls of the pipe are combined into one. This wall should
be of heavy cast brass, free from sand holes.</p>

<p><i>Clean Sweep Trap</i>, <a href="#Fig_63">Fig. 63</a>. Some clean sweep traps are
dependent upon an inside wall for their seals. They are
made of <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-S, <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>-S, and full S.</p>

<p><i>Sure Seal Trap.</i> The sure seal trap is designed to be
non-syphoning. This trap also has an interior waterway.
If this waterway leaks, the trap is unfit for use. If these
traps are made as shown in the second sketch with the way
inside of a larger pipe, it can be detected if the interior
wall leaks.</p>

<p><i>Centrifugal Trap.</i> The centrifugal trap is made similar
to the clean sweep, except that the wall of the inlet pipe is
entirely separate from the body of the trap. The inlet
enters the body of the trap on a tangent, thus making the
trap self-scouring which is a good feature.</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Pipe Threading</span></h3>

<p>The proper cutting of threads on pipe is overlooked by
some mechanics. There are many different kinds of dies
and different kinds of pipe to contend with. Steel pipe
threads very hard and the adjustable dies should be used
on it. These dies cut more easily and leave a cleaner
thread than other dies when used on steel pipe. When
threads are cut on wrought-iron pipe the adjustable dies
should be used as they cut a better and cleaner thread
than other dies. To preserve the life of the dies and the
quality of the thread, oil is used freely while the dies are
cutting.</p>

<p><b>Threads.</b>&mdash;The standard thread on pipe and fittings is a
right-handed thread. Left threads can be cut on the pipe
and the fitting can be tapped with a left thread. When a
fitting is tapped with a left thread it is marked so. The
following table gives the standard number of threads that
a die will or should be allowed to cut on the pipe:</p>

<p>To acquaint the beginner with iron pipe work, the following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
exercise is given. In it there are a great many of
the actual problems that come up when the pipe is put in on
a job. This is the last exercise that is required in this book.
The sketch shows clearly just what the job is and below I
have gone over each operation that is necessary to complete
the job.</p>

<div class="figs">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 426px;">
<a name="Fig_67" id="Fig_67"></a><a href="images/fig67.gif"><img src="images/fig67tn.gif" width="426" height="500" class="plain" alt="Fig. 67." title="Fig. 67." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 67.</span>
</div></div>

<p><b>Materials Necessary.</b>&mdash;Six feet of 1-inch black pipe;
four 1-inch black ells; two 1-inch tee; one 1-inch right
and left coupling; oil.</p>

<p><b>Tools Necessary.</b>&mdash;Two 14-inch pipe wrenches, vise,
pipe cutters, stock and 1-inch follower right and left die
and reamer.</p>

<p>The vise is made secure on a bench or post, care being
taken before it is put in place to provide room enough to
swing the stocks. A length of 1-inch pipe is put into the
vise and the vise clamped around it. The end of the pipe
that is to be threaded should stick out through the vise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
about 9 inches. If there is a thread on this end, the dies
should be run over it to make sure that it is a standard
thread and to clean the threads. Before proceeding further
with this exercise the dies and stocks will be described and
their use shown.</p>

<p><b>Dies.</b>&mdash;A full set of dies is taken. The full set of stocks
and dies is composed of right and left dies from <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> inch up
to 1 inch, with a guide for each size, also a small wrench
with which to turn the set screws. The dies come in sets,
two in a set. These are the Armstrong patent that I am
describing. Take the stock and the handles, and a set
of 1-inch right dies with the guides out of the box. The
dies will have marked on them 1" R (if 1-inch left were
wanted, the mark would be 1" L). The set screws are
taken out of the stock and the dies inserted in their proper
place. There is a deep mark on the edge of each die and
under it a letter S. This letter means "standard." This
mark on the die is set even with a similar mark on the stock
and when the set screws are in place and tightened, a standard
thread will be cut. There is an adjusting screw on the
stock to make the proper adjustment on the dies.</p>

<p><b>Stock.</b>&mdash;The stock is taken and the handles are put into
it. There are two sets of set screws on the stock, one set
for holding the dies in place and the other set for adjusting
the dies. On the stock there is a deep mark to correspond
with the standard thread mark on the dies. On the
opposite side of the stock there is a place for the follower
and a set screw to hold it in place. After the stocks have
been looked over and examined thoroughly, the 1-inch
right dies are taken and inserted. Then the 1-inch follower
is put in place. The tool is now ready to cut a 1-inch
thread. Now take a piece of 1-inch pipe at least 15 inches
long and put it in the vise, letting it extend out from the vise
about 9 inches. The stock is now taken and the follower
end is put on the pipe first and the dies brought up in place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to cut. The end of the pipe is allowed to enter in between
the two dies so that the teeth of each die rest on the pipe.
Now, holding the handles of the stock about 6 inches from
the body of the stock and standing directly in front of the
pipe, push and turn to the right at the same time and the
dies will be started. Now put some oil on the dies and
turn the stock, taking hold of the ends of the handles
and standing at one side. The dies are run up on the pipe
until the pipe extends through the face of the dies one
thread. Oil is put on the pipe and the dies at least twice
during the cutting. When the thread is long enough the
stock is turned back a little and then forward a little and the
loose chips are blown out from between the dies and pipe.
If the dies are set right, a good clean standard thread will
have been cut. This thread can now be cut off with the
pipe cutters.</p>

<p><b>Pipe Cutters.</b>&mdash;To cut pipe with a one-wheel pipe cutter
is a simple matter. I will not dwell at length on the cutter
itself. There are one-wheel and three-wheel cutters. We
will use a one-wheel cutter tool. This cutter is forced into
the surface of the pipe with a set screw having a long tee
handle. The pressure that is brought to bear on the pipe
while being cut is sufficient to cause a large burr to form on
the inside of the pipe. Sometimes the pipe is completely
crushed and rendered unfit for use. Therefore the user of
these cutters should exercise care when cutting pipe. The
pipe is put in the vise and the cutters are so put on the pipe
that the pipe will be between the two rollers and the cutter
wheel, the cutter resting on the mark that indicates the
point at which the pipe is to be cut. The handle is screwed
down and the cutters turned around the pipe; each time the
cutters make a complete turn the handle is screwed down
more. This procedure is continued until the furrow has
been cut clear through the pipe.</p>

<p><b>Cutting and Threading Nipples.</b>&mdash;Nipples are short<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
pieces of pipe threaded on each end. Pieces of pipe longer
than 6 inches are not called nipples. When a nipple is so
short that the threads cut on each end meet in the center of
the piece, the nipple is called a "close nipple." When there
is a space of about <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> inch between the threads, it is called
a "space or shoulder" nipple. To cut and thread these
nipples a nipple chuck or nipple holder is necessary.</p>

<div class="figs">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig_68" id="Fig_68"></a><a href="images/fig68.gif"><img src="images/fig68tn.gif" width="500" height="277" class="plain" alt="Fig. 68.--Nipple chuck and nipples." title="Fig. 68.&mdash;Nipple chuck and nipples." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 68.&mdash;Nipple chuck and nipples.</span>
</div></div>

<p><b>Nipple Holders.</b>&mdash;Take a piece of 1-inch pipe about 12
inches long and on one end cut a thread that is 2 inches
long. Take a 1-inch coupling and screw it on this end
until the end of the pipe is almost through the end of the
coupling. At least four threads should be allowed at this
end of the coupling. Now we have a piece of pipe 12 inches
long having a thread 2 inches long on one end with a coupling
on the thread. This is called a nipple holder. Now, to
cut a nipple, cut a thread on a piece of pipe and cut the
pipe off at any desired length, say 2 inches. Put the nipple
holder in the vise with the coupling out from the vise about
8 inches. Take the 2-inch piece of pipe with a thread on
one end, screw this thread into the coupling until it touches
the pipe that has been screwed through from the other end.
Now the stocks having the 1 dies and the follower in are
put on the pipe. The follower will not go over the coupling,
therefore take the follower out of the stock. Now the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
stock will slip over the coupling and the thread can be
cut. With this procedure a nipple of any length can be
cut. There are a number of patented nipple chucks on the
market, but as they are not always at hand the above
method is resorted to and serves every purpose.</p>

<p><b>Long Screws.</b>&mdash;To cut a long screw which comes in use
frequently on vent pipe work, a piece of pipe 12 inches long
is taken and a regular length thread is cut on one end, and
a thread 4 inches long is cut on the other end. Then a
coupling is cut while screwed on a pipe, so that a lock nut
about <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> inch wide is made. The description and use of
these long screws will come under screw pipe venting.</p>

<p>Now that the proper use of the tools has been explained,
we will proceed with the exercise according to the sketch.
With a length of pipe in the vise and the 1-inch dies in the
stock, run over the thread on the pipe. Note that all the
measurements are center to center. Screw an elbow on
the pipe and measure off the first length, which we will take
as 12 inches center to center. Place the rule on the pipe
with one end of it at the center of the opening of the elbow
just screwed on. Mark 12 inches off on the pipe. This
mark represents the center of another ell. Now take
another ell and hold the center of one outlet on this mark.
It will readily be seen that to have the measurement come
right, the pipe must be cut off at a point where it will make
up tight when screwed into the ell. Therefore, about
1 inch will have to be cut off, making the pipe 1 inch shorter
than where it was first marked. Cut the pipe, and before
taking it out of the vise make a thread on the pipe still
in the vise. After the thread is cut, take the reamer and
ream out the burr that is on the inside of the pipe caused
by the pipe cutter. An elbow can be screwed on this pipe.
The next measurement is marked off as explained, the pipe
cut, then the piece in the vise threaded and reamed. The
measurements must be accurate and the dies should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
adjusted to cut all threads the same depth. When the
measurements are all out, there should be seven pieces of
pipe, each piece having one thread. Now the threads on
the other end can be cut except the 12 inch piece that screws
into the right and left coupling. This thread is a left-handed
thread and must be cut with the left dies. Change
the dies now to the 1-inch left dies; turn the stock in the
opposite direction of the right-hand thread, and the dies
will cut the left thread. The pipe and the fittings can easily
be put together as shown in the sketch by following the
center to center measurements. The right and left coupling
is the only fitting that will cause the beginner trouble. A
right and left coupling can be used only when there is
sufficient <i>give</i> to the pipe, that is, the two ends of the pipe
to be coupled together are only <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> inch apart. To get the
coupling in place to start the threads, the pipe must spread
apart at least 2 inches. If the pipe cannot be spread that
much, a right and left coupling cannot be used. The proper
way to make up a right and left coupling is as follows:</p>

<div class="figs">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig_69" id="Fig_69"></a><a href="images/fig69.gif"><img src="images/fig69tn.gif" width="500" height="215" class="plain" alt="Fig. 69.--F reads center of ell to end, C reads center of ell to center
of valve, D reads center of valve to center of T, E reads center of T to
center of ell." title="Fig. 69.&mdash;F reads center of ell to end, C reads center " /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 69.&mdash;F reads center of ell to end, C reads center of ell to center
of valve, D reads center of valve to center of T, E reads center of T to
center of ell.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Screw home the coupling on the right thread. Mark with
a piece of chalk on the coupling and the pipe showing a point
on each where the coupling makes tight. Take off the
coupling and count the turns and make note of the number.
Now do the same on the left thread and make a note of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
number of threads. If the left thread has six turns and the
right has four and one-half, then to insure that the left
thread will be tight when the right thread is, the coupling
must be put on the left thread one and one-half turns before
it is started on the right thread. Now with four and one-half
turns, the right and the left threads will both be tight.
A little thought and practice will make this connection
clear. If all the measurements in this exercise are not cut
accurately, the right and left coupling will not go together.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cold-water Supply. Test</span></h3>


<p>The supplying of cold water to buildings and then piping
it to the various fixtures makes a very interesting study.
We have gone over the methods of laying and piping for
the house service pipe. We will go over the different systems
now employed to supply the water, quickly.</p>

<p><b>Underground Water.</b>&mdash;In thinly populated districts the
well is still employed to supply water to the building.
The water is brought to the surface by means of a large
bucket or by means of a pump. A well point can be driven
into the ground until water is reached and then the water
can be brought to the surface by means of a pump operated
by hand or by power. The water can be forced to a tank
that is open and elevated, or forced into a tank that is
closed and put under pressure. From either tank the water
will flow to any desired outlets. A windmill can be employed
to furnish power to operate the pump. Water
supply that is received directly from underground is by far
the best to use. A cesspool or outhouse must not be allowed
on the premises with a well, otherwise the well will
be contaminated and unfit for domestic use. An open
well is not as sanitary as a driven well, as the surface water
and leaves, etc., get into it and decay and pollute the water,
and soon make it unfit for domestic use.</p>

<p><b>Streams and Brooks.</b>&mdash;The brooks and streams furnish
a good source of supply for water to a building or community
of buildings. The writer recently worked on a system
of piping that supplied 15 or 20 buildings. The water
supply came from a brook that was higher than the houses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Each house had a separate pipe leading down from the brook
into a tank from which the house was piped. The owner
of the brook applied business ethics to the privileges of
taking water from it. He had a scale of prices, and the
highest-priced location was an inch or so below the bed of
the brook, the next price was level with the bottom, the
next cheaper 2 inches above the bottom. As the surface
was reached, the privilege cost less. In the dry time of the
year those at the bottom of the brook always had water
while those at the top location had to wait for the water to
rise, and had to do without water during the dry time.
Where the stream is on a lower level than the building a
hydraulic ram can be used.</p>

<p><b>Rivers and Lakes.</b>&mdash;Rivers and lakes make an abundant
supply for water systems. A sluggish-moving river is bad,
also a river that is used for carrying off the sewage of a town.
Special provision is now made for the using of water that is
polluted. A lake that is supplied by springs is by far the
best source of supply. The water is pumped from the river
or lake into a reservoir and then flows by gravity into mains
and from the mains into the buildings. The water should
always be filtered before it is allowed to enter the distributing
mains.</p>

<p><b>Water Pressure.</b>&mdash;Pressure at a fixture or outlet so that
the water will flow is generally obtained by the force of
gravity. When this method is not sufficient, a pneumatic
system is employed. This method is employed to force the
water to the top floors or to supply the whole building in
high structures. The pneumatic system requires a pump,
an air-tight tank, and pipes to the various outlets. The
water pumped into the air-tight tank will occupy part of
the space generally occupied by the air. The air cannot
escape and is, therefore, compressed. Continued pumping
will compress the air until the limit of the apparatus is
reached. If a valve or faucet that is connected with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
tank is opened, the air will expand and force the water out
of the opening. This explains in a general way the operation
of a pneumatic water-supply system. Water can be
pumped into this air-tight tank from a well, cistern, river,
lake, or from the city supply mains.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 70.&mdash;&quot;Banjo.&quot;</span>
</div></div>

<p><b>Piping.</b>&mdash;From the service pipe on which there has been
placed a shut-off, a line of piping, full size, is run through
the basement, overhead to a convenient place, perhaps to
a partition in the center of the cellar. The pipe is brought
down and connected into the end of a header. This header
or banjo is made of Ts placed 4 inches center to center.
From each T a line of pipe is run to each isolated fixture
or set of fixtures (see <a href="#Fig_70">Fig. 70</a>). A stop and waste cock is
placed on each line at such a point that all stop cocks will
come in a row near the header. A small pipe is run from
the waste of each stop and discharged into a larger pipe
which connects with a sink. This way of running pipes
while it is expensive makes a very neat and good job. Each
stop cock has a tag on it stating explicitly what it controls.
If the building is a large one a number of these panelled
headers are used. A less expensive way to run this pipe
is to branch off from the main at points where the branch
pipe will be as short as possible and use as few fittings as
possible. Stop and waste cocks are then placed on each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
branch near the main.</p>

<p>All pipe must follow the direct line of fitting with which
it is connected. The line of pipe should be perfectly
straight. If it seems necessary to bend the pipe to get
around an obstacle, then good judgment has not been used
in placing the fitting into which the pipe is screwed. The
fitting should be re-located so that the pipe can be run
without bending. To have true alignment of pipes the
whole job or section of the job must be drawn out on paper
first and any obstacles noted and avoided before the piping
is cut. This not only saves time but it is also the forerunner
of a good job. When getting measurements for
piping the same rule or tape should be used to get out the
pipe as was used to get the measurements.</p>

<p>The water main and branches that run through the
basement of a building are generally hung on the ceiling.
Rough hangers of wood, rope, or wire are usually used to
hold the pipe in place at first, then neat and strong adjustable
hangers are placed every 8 feet apart. There are in
use too many kinds of hangers to explain or describe them
here. The essential point of all good hangers is to have
them strong, neat, and so made that perfect alignment of
the pipe can be had. The hangers should be so placed that
no strain will come on the fitting or the valves. A hanger
should be placed near each side of unions so that when the
union is taken apart neither side of the pipe will drop and
bend. Hooks and straps should be used to hold vertical
pipes rigid and in position. A vertical pipe should be so
held in place that its weight will come on the hooks and
straps that hold it rather than on the horizontal pipe into
which it connects. Where there are six or eight horizontal
lines of pipes close together, a separate hanger for each
pipe makes a rather cumbersome job and it consumes considerable
time to install them properly. A hanger having
one support run under all the pipes will allow space for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
proper alignment and adjustment for drainage. Allowance
must be made on all lines of pipe for drainage. When
a building is vacant during cold weather, the water is
drawn off; therefore, the pipes should have a pitch to certain
points where the pipes can be opened and the entire
system drained of water.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of Pipe.</b>&mdash;The kind of pipe that is used for cold-water
supply depends on and varies according to the kind
of water, the kind of earth through which it runs, and the
construction of the building. Wrought iron, steel, lead,
brass, tin-lined brass, are in use.</p>

<p>The supply pipe to every fixture should have a stop on it
directly under the fixture. This will allow the water to be
shut off for repairs to the faucet without stopping the supply
of other fixtures.</p>

<p>The making of perfect threads on pipe is an important
matter, especially on water pipes. If the pipe and the dies
were perfect, and the mechanic used sufficient oil in cutting,
and the fittings were perfectly tapped to correspond to the
dies used on the pipe, of course a perfect union between pipe
and fitting would result and the joint would be found to be
perfect on screwing the pipe home. As all the above conditions
are not found on the job, threads are made tight by
the use of red or white lead and oil. The lead is put on the
thread and when the thread is made up the lead will have
been forced into any imperfection that may be in the threads
and the joint will then be water-tight. White lead and oil
should be used on nickel-plated pipe as other pipe compounds
are too conspicuous and look badly. A pipe compound
should be used with discretion, for if too much is put on a
burr of it will collect in the bore of the pipe and reduce it
considerably. This is not tolerated, so only a small amount
is used. Water pipes should be run in accessible places,
making it possible to get at them in case of trouble. In
climates that have freezing weather water pipes should not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
be run in outside partitions. If it is found absolutely
necessary to do so, as in the case of buildings which have
no inside partitions on the first floor, the pipe should be
properly covered and protected. The different methods
of covering pipes are described in <a href="#CHAPTER_XV">Chapter XV</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Hot-water Heaters. Instantaneous Coil and<br />
Storage Tanks. Return Circulation,<br />
Hot-water Lines and Expansion</span></h3>


<p>The problem of supplying hot water to plumbing fixtures
is one that has required years of study. Each job today
demands considerable thought to make it a perfect and
satisfactory hot-water system. We will find installations
today where the water is red from rust, where there is
water pounding and cracking. There are also jobs where
the fixtures get practically no hot water. As each job or
individual building has its own peculiar conditions, they
must be solved by the designer or the mechanic, using the
fundamental principles of hot-water circulation. We must
first know how much hot water is to be used, also the location
of the outlets and the construction of the building;
then the size of the pipes and the size of the tanks and their
locations can be settled. If the job is a large one, a pump
may be employed to insure the proper circulation. After
this the pipe sizes and connections can be worked out. The
one great enemy of hot-water circulation is air. Therefore,
no traps or air pockets should ever appear in the piping
system. The boiler, as it is often referred to, is the hot-water
storage tank. A copper or iron tank holding sufficient
water to supply all fixtures, even when every fixture
demands a supply at the same time, is installed in a convenient
place and the heating arrangement connected with
it. A thermostat can be placed on the system and the
temperature of the water controlled. According to the size
of the building the problem of furnishing the plumbing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
fixtures with hot water increases.</p>

<p><b>Methods of Heating Hot Water.</b>&mdash;There are a number of
ways of furnishing hot water. Some of the installations
are listed below.</p>

<p>A cast-iron or brass water back is placed on the fire pot
of a stove or furnace. A separate stove with the fire pot
and water jacket is used. A coil of steam pipe is placed
inside a hot-water boiler or tank. Gas coil heaters are
connected with hot water storage tank, also gas coil instantaneous
heaters are connected with the piping direct.</p>

<p>Combinations of the above systems are in use and serve
the purpose for which they are intended. For instance,
the tank can be connected with a coal range and a gas coil
heater, heat being furnished by the range alone or the coil
heater alone, or both can be used at the same time. This
combination can be connected with the furnace in the cellar,
and during the winter months, when the furnace is in
use, the water can be heated by the furnace coil. In warm
weather, when the furnace is out, the range can supply the
necessary heat. In hot weather the coil gas heater can
supply the heat.</p>

<p><b>Connections of Tank and Heating Apparatus.</b>&mdash;The ordinary
house boiler or hot-water storage tank has four connections,
two on top, one on the side, and one on the bottom.
The top connections are used for the entrance of cold water
into the tank and for the supply of hot water to the fixtures
(see <a href="#Fig_71">Fig. 71</a>). The cold-water inlet has a tube extending
into the tank below the side connection. This tube has
a small hole filed in it about 6 inches from the top. This
hole is to break any syphonic action that may occur at any
time. The side connection is for the connection of the pipe
coming from the top of the water back. The bottom opening
in the tank is for the connection of the pipe coming from
the lower water back connection, also for draining the
boiler. The circulation of the water can be followed thus:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
cold water enters the boiler in the tube and discharges
into the boiler below the side connection. From here it
flows out of the bottom connection into the water back,
through the upper connection into the boiler, through the
side opening, then to the top of the boiler and out to the
fixtures through the fixture supply opening.</p>

<div class="figs">

<span class="caption">Fig. 71.&mdash;Storage tank, and coil heater with thermostatic control valve.</span>
</div></div>

<p><a href="#Fig_69">Fig. 69</a> shows a thermostatic control valve attached to
the bottom of a heater coil, and at the side of storage tank.
The best arrangement is at the bottom, for it does not
shut off the gas supply until the boiler is full of hot water.</p>

<p><b>Connecting Tank and Coil Gas Heater.</b>&mdash;The boiler and
the coil gas heater have a different connection. The
bottom of the tank and the bottom of the heater are connected.
The top of the heater and the top of the boiler
are connected. The accompanying sketch shows how this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
connection is made. If the tee on the top of the boiler
into which the gas-heater connection is made is not the
first fitting and placed as close to the outlet as possible,
the water will not circulate freely into the boiler. This
connection according to the drawing should be studied
and memorized.</p>

booster." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 72.&mdash;Instantaneous gas heater. Showing circulation heater or
booster.</span>
</div></div>

<p><b>Instantaneous Gas-heater Connections.</b>&mdash;An instantaneous
gas heater is placed in the basement. The copper
coil in it is connected at the bottom with the cold-water
supply and the top outlet of the coil is connected with the
hot-water system of piping. There is no need of a storage
tank with this heater. When a faucet is opened in any part
of the hot-water piping system, the water passing through
the water valve at the heater causes the gas valve to open
so that the whole set of burners in the heater is supplied
with gas, and the burners are lighted from a pilot light.
When the faucet is closed, the gas supply is shut off and
the burners are put out. The pilot is lighted all the time.
Space will not permit going over these connections in detail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
It is a large field and requires considerable thought.</p>

<p><b>Safety and Check Valves.</b>&mdash;When a meter is used on a
water system, the water company demands that a check
valve be placed on the hot-water system to prevent the
hot water from being forced back into the meter in case the
pressure got strong enough in the boiler. If a check valve
is used for this purpose, or for any other purpose, a safety
valve must be placed on the boiler piping system to relieve
any excessive pressure that may be caused by having the
check valve in use. There is today, with meters of modern
type, no reason to use a check valve or a safety valve. If
an excessive pressure is obtained in the boiler, it is relieved
in the water main.</p>

<p>When water is heated, it expands. If the heat becomes
more intense and steam is formed, the expansion is much
greater, and some means must be provided to allow for it.
This expansion can be allowed to relieve itself in the water
main as explained above. When a check valve is placed
on the piping, this means of escape is shut off and a safety
valve must be employed. Without these reliefs, the pressure
would be so great that an explosion would result.
When steel pipe and steel boilers are used for storage tanks
and connections, the pipe and tank will shortly start to
rust and parts of the piping are stopped up with rust
scales. The water also becomes red with rust when the
water becomes hot enough to circulate. When the pipes
are stopped up, steam is formed and a snapping and cracking
sound is heard. To avoid these conditions, the piping
should be of brass or lead and the storage tank should be
of copper. The installation cost of brass and copper is
greater than steel, but they will not have to be replaced in
two or three years, as is the case with other material. A
valve should be placed on the cold-water supply to control
the entire hot-water piping system. A pipe with a stop cock
should be placed underneath the boiler and should extend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
into a sink in the basement so that the boiler can be drained
at any time for cleaning or repairs.</p>

<p><b>Connecting with Fixtures.</b>&mdash;To have all fixtures properly
supplied with hot water it is necessary to run what is termed
a circulating pipe. This circulating pipe is a circuit of
pipe extending from the top of the boiler to the vicinity of
the fixtures and then returning to the boiler and connecting
into the pipe leading out of the bottom of the boiler. From
this circuit all branches are taken to supply all fixtures
requiring hot water. This circulating pipe has hot water
circulating through it all the time. Therefore the fixtures
are supplied with hot water very quickly. The circulating
pipe and its branches are run without any traps or air
pockets.</p>

<p>When running the piping, it should be borne in mind that
not only does the water expand when heated, but the pipe
expands also. Therefore due allowance must be made for
this expansion. The long risers should have an expansion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
loop as shown in Figs. <a href="#Fig_73">73</a>, <a href="#Fig_74">74</a> and <a href="#Fig_75">75</a>. There are installed on
some jobs what is known as an expansion joint. This will
allow for the expansion and contraction of the pipe. The
writer's experience with these joints has not been very
satisfactory. After a while these joints begin to leak and
they must have attention which in some cases is rather expensive.
An expansion loop as shown in the sketch, made
with elbows, will prove satisfactory. If the threads on the
fittings and pipe are good, no leak will appear on this joint.</p>

<p>All gas heaters must be connected with a flue to carry
off the products of combustion.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Insulation of Piping to Eliminate Conduction,<br />
Radiation, Freezing, and Noise</span></h3>


<p><b>Pipe Covering.</b>&mdash;Pipe covering is another important
branch of plumbing. A few years ago heating pipes were
the only pipes that it was thought necessary to cover.
The ever-increasing demands made by the public keep the
wideawake plumber continually solving problems. The
water running down a waste pipe, for instance, will annoy
some people, and provision must be made to avoid this
noise or to silence it. This is one of the many problems
that the plumber must solve by the use of pipe covering.</p>

<p><b>Pipes that Need Covering.</b>&mdash;First of all, the covering
must be put on properly to be of high service. <i>Hot-water
circulating pipes</i> need covering to reduce the amount of
heat loss. If the pipes and the tank are not covered, considerable
more fuel will be needed to supply the necessary
amount of hot water than if the pipes and tank were covered
with a good covering. <i>Cold-water pipes</i> need covering in
places to keep them from freezing. They also need covering
under some conditions to keep them from sweating. They
are covered also to prevent the material which surrounds
them from coming into direct contact with the pipe.
<i>Waste pipes</i> need covering to prevent them from freezing
and to silence the noise caused by the rush of water through
them. <i>Ice-water pipes</i> are covered to prevent the water
from rising in temperature and to prevent any condensation
forming on the pipe. There is need for such a variety
of covering that I have listed below some of them and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
methods employed for putting them on the pipe.</p>

<p>Magnesia, asbestos air cell, molded asbestos, wool felt,
waterproof paper and wool felt, cork, hair felt. These
coverings come in the form of pipe covering with a cloth
jacket. They also come in the shape of fittings as well as
in blocks and rolls of paper, and in powdered form. Any
thickness that is desired may be had. The pipe covering
is readily put on the pipe. The cloth jacket is pulled back
a short distance and the covering will open like a book.
It can then be clamped on the pipe and the jacket pulled
back and pasted into place. Brass bands, 1 inch wide,
come with the pipe covering. These are put on and the
pipe covering is then held securely in place. Practically
all the coverings are applied in this manner and are made up
in 3-foot lengths to fit any size pipe. To cover the fittings
and valves, the same kind of sectional covering can be
obtained and applied in the same manner as the pipe
covering. Plastic covering is often applied to the fittings
and molded into the shape of the fitting. The plastic
covering comes in bags and is dry. It is mixed with warm
water to the consistency of thick cement and applied with a
trowel. When the covering is put on the pipes and fittings,
it should be done thoroughly to get satisfactory results.
Each section of the covering has on one end an extra length
of the jacket. This is to allow a lap over on the next section
to make a tight joint. If the sections need fitting, a
saw can be used and the covering cut to any desired length.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Magnesia</i> covering is employed mostly on steam pipes,
especially high-pressure. This material can be had in the
shape of pipe covering, in blocks, or cement.</p>

<p><i>Asbestos air cell</i> covering is employed to cover hot-water
circulating pipes. It is constructed of corrugated asbestos
paper. This material is manufactured in the sectional pipe
covering or in corrugated paper form.</p>

<p><i>Molded asbestos</i> covering is also used on hot-water pipes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and is manufactured in pipe covering or in blocks.</p>

<p><i>Wool felt</i> covering is used mostly on hot-water pipes and
makes one of the best coverings. It is lined with asbestos
paper and covered with a cloth jacket.</p>

<p><i>Waterproof paper and wool felt</i> is used on cold-water
pipes and is made in 3-foot lengths. The covering is lined
with waterproof paper and covered with a cloth jacket.</p>

<p><i>Cork.</i>&mdash;A heavy cork covering is one of the best coverings
for ice-water pipes, and a light cork covering is used for cold-water
pipes. This covering comes in sections as other
coverings, also in blocks and sheets.</p>

<p><i>Hair felt</i> is used to prevent pipes from freezing. It
comes in bales containing 150 to 300 square feet of various
thicknesses.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">"Durham" or "Screw Pipe" Work. Pipe and<br />
Fittings</span></h3>


<p>"Durham" or "screw pipe" work is the name used to denote
that the job is installed by the use of wrought-iron or
steel screw pipe. We speak of a "cast-iron job" meaning
that cast-iron pipe was used for the piping. A completely
different method of work is used when screw pipe is employed
for the wastes and vents. When screw pipe is to
be used or considered for use, it is well to know something
concerning the various makes of screw pipe. Nothing but
galvanized pipe is ever used. The value of steel screw pipe
and wrought-iron screw pipe should be studied, and every
person interested should, if possible, understand how these
different pipes are made and how the material of which they
are composed is made. In some places one pipe is better
than another and a study of their make-up would enlighten
the user and allow him to use the best for his peculiar conditions.
The maker's name should always be on the pipe.

<p>Screw pipe work came into common use with the advance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of modern steel structures. Some difficulty had been experienced
in getting the cast-iron pipe joints tight and to
keep the pipe so anchored that it would not crack. The
screw pipe was found to answer all of the requirements of
modern structures and therefore has been used extensively.
The life of screw pipe is not as long as extra heavy cast-iron
pipe. This is the only serious objection to screw pipe,
which must be renewed after a term of years, while extra
heavy cast iron lasts indefinitely. Screw pipe is never used
underground. When piping is required underground, extra
heavy cast-iron pipe is used.</p>


<h3>PIPING</h3>

<p>The pipe used in Durham work is galvanized extra heavy,
or standard wrought-iron, or steel pipe. It is almost impossible
to recognize wrought-iron from steel pipe without
the aid of a chemical or a magnifying glass. To test the
pipe to distinguish its base, take a sharp file and file through
the surface of the pipe that is to be tested. If the pipe is
steel, under a magnifying glass the texture of the filed surface
will appear to be smooth and have small irregular-shaped
grains, and there will also be an appearance of
compactness. If the pipe is iron, the texture will have the
appearance of being ragged and will show streaks of slag
or black. When screw pipe is cut there is always left a
large burr on the inside of the pipe. This burr greatly
reduces the bore of the pipe and is a source of stoppage in
waste pipes. After the pipe is cut this burr should be
reamed out thoroughly. One of the strong points of screw
pipe is the strength of each joint. Care should therefore
be taken to see that perfect threads are cut on the pipe and
that the threads of the fittings are perfect. The dies should
be set right and not varied on each joint. There should be
plenty of oil used when threads are cut so that the thread<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
will be clean and sharp. The follower or guide on stocks
should be the same size as the pipe that is being threaded,
otherwise a crooked thread will result. If a pipe-threading
machine is used, the pipe is set squarely between the jaws
of the vise that holds the pipe in place. When cutting
a thread on a long length of pipe, the end sticking out from
the machine must be supported firmly so that no strain
will come on the machine as the pipe turns. It is necessary
to cut crooked threads sometimes on the pipe to allow
the pipe pitch for drainage or to bring the pipe into alignment
where fitting would take up too much room. To cut
a crooked thread on a piece of pipe, simply leave the follower
out of the stock or put in the size larger. The dies not having
a guide will cut a crooked thread. Piping should be
run with as few threads as possible. With a thorough knowledge
of and the intelligent use of fittings, a minimum number
of threads will result.</p>

<p>The pipes in a building are run in compact parallel lines
in chases designed especially for them. The tendency is to
confine the pipes to certain localities as much as possible.
This makes a very neat job and in case repairs are needed,
the work and trouble incurred will be confined to one section.</p>


<h3>FITTINGS</h3>

<p>The fittings used in screw pipe work are cast-iron recess
type (see <a href="#Fig_54">Fig. 54</a>). The fittings are so made that the inside
bores of the pipe and the fittings come in direct line with
each other, thus making a smooth inside surface at all bends.
The fittings are all heavily galvanized. All fittings should be
examined on the inside for any lumps of metal of sufficient
size to catch solid waste matter, and these must be removed
or the fitting discarded. All 90&deg; bends, whether Ts or
elbows, are tapped to give the pipe that connects with them
a pitch of at least <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> inch to the foot. Except where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
obligatory, 90&deg; fittings should not be used. To make a
bend of 90&deg; a Y-branch, a nipple and a 45&deg; bend should be
used, or two 45&deg; bends will make a long easy sweep of the
drainage pipes and reduce the possibility of stoppage.</p>

<p>Y-branches are inserted every 30 feet at least to allow for
a clean-out which can be placed in the branch of the fitting.
When a clean-out is placed an iron plug should not be used.
These plugs are not removed very often and an iron plug
will rust in and be almost impossible to get out. Brass
clean-out plugs are used and are easily taken out.</p>

<p>At times it is necessary to connect cast iron and wrought
iron, or in a line where a union could be used if the pipe were
not a waste pipe, a tucker fitting is used. This fitting is
threaded on one end and has a socket on the other to allow
for caulking. To get a good idea of all the fittings in general
use, the reader should get a catalogue from one of the fitting
manufacturers and a survey of it will give the names and
sizes of the fittings. However, I show a few common ones.
In the writer's opinion, the studying of the catalogue would
be of more benefit than a description of fittings at this
point. The sizes used and the methods employed to vent
the waste-pipe systems are the same as in cast-iron work.</p>


<h3>HANGERS AND SUPPORTS</h3>

<p>The hanging of screw pipe is a very essential point. The
taking of the strain off from a fitting or line of pipe by the
use of a hanger is the means of avoiding serious trouble
after a job is completed. On horizontal runs hangers are
placed not more than 8 feet apart. In a building constructed
of wood, the hangers are secured to the joists.
In a building constructed of steel beams and concrete the
hangers are secured to the steel beams by means of I-beam
hangers that clamp on the beams; also in the case of concrete
the hangers are extended through the floor and a T<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
is put on the hanger on top of the cement floor; an iron bar
or a short piece of smaller pipe run through the T holds the
hanger in place and secures it rigidly. The finished floor is
laid over the hanger so that it does not show from the top.
Hangers on the vertical lines should be placed at every
joint and under each fitting. To have the pipe in true
alignment, the hangers must be hung and placed in line.
Every riser line must have an extra support at the base to
avoid any settling of the stack which will crack the fittings
and break fixture connections.</p>


<h3>MEASUREMENTS</h3>

<p>The proper installation of screw pipe work requires getting
correct and accurate measurements. Every plumber
is or should be able to get correct center to center, center to
end, end to end, center to back, and end to back measurements.
In Durham work 45&deg; angles are continually occurring.
To get these measurements correctly, the following
table has been compiled as used by the author and found to
be correct. The reader should memorize it so that it may
be used without referring to the book.</p>

</table></div>

<p>Before any measurements are taken, the lines of pipe are
laid out and the position of each fitting known. As I
have stated before, the plumber must look ahead with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
work. He must have the ability of practically seeing the
pipe in place before the work is started. This requires
experience and judgment. Before the measurements are
taken and the pipe cut consideration must be given to the
fact that the fittings and pipes must be screwed into position.
Therefore, "can the fitting on the pipe be placed
where it is laid out when this is considered?" must be one of
the many questions a plumber should ask himself. Allowance
must be made for the chain tongs to swing. Whenever
possible, a fitting is made up on the pipe while the pipe
is in the vise.</p>

</div></div>


<h3>FIXTURE CONNECTIONS</h3>

<p>The fixture connections when screw pipe is used are necessarily
different than when cast-iron pipe is used. A brass
nipple is wiped on a piece of lead pipe and then screwed into
the fitting left for the closet connection. The lead is
flanged over above the floor and the closet set on it. The
lead is soldered to a brass flange. The brass flange is
secured to the floor and then the closet bowl secured to the
brass flange. Another method employed is to screw a brass
flange into the fitting so that when it is made up the flange
will come level with the floor; the closet bowl is then secured
to this flange. There are a number of patented floor
flanges for closet bowl connections that can be used to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
advantage. Slop sinks have practically the same connections
as the closets. Other fixtures such as the urinal,
lavatory, and bath, can be connected with a short piece of
lead wiped on a solder nipple, or the trimmings for the fixture
can be had with brass having iron pipe size threads,
and the connection can then be made directly with the
outlet on the waste line. This is a very general way to
describe the connections, but space will not allow a detailed
description of these connections. It is always well
to allow for short lead connections for fixtures so that the
lead will give if the stack settles.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Gas Fitting, Pipe and Fittings, Threading, Measuring,<br />
and Testing</span></h3>


<h3>GAS AND ITS USE IN BUILDINGS</h3>

<p>Gas is in common use in all classes of buildings today.
Dwellings use it for cooking and illuminating, factories,
office buildings, and public buildings for power. In some
parts of the country natural gas is found. In these places
it is used freely for heating fuel. The actual making of
gas is something that every plumber should understand.
If space permitted I would describe a gas plant with all of
its by-products. However, we shall deal only with the
actual installation of gas piping in buildings. Gas mains
are run through the streets the same as water mains are
run. Branches are taken off these mains and extended
into the buildings requiring gas. The gas company
generally installs the gas service pipe inside of the basement
wall and places a stop cock on it free of charge. This stop
that is placed on the pipe is a plug core type, the handle
for turning it off is square, and a wrench is required to
turn it. The square top has a lug on it. There is also a
lug corresponding to it on the body of the valve. When
the valve is shut off, these two lugs are together. Each
lug has a hole in it large enough for a padlock ring to pass
through. This gives the gas company absolute control of
the gas in the building.</p>

<p><b>Setting of the Meter.</b>&mdash;Every building that is supplied
with gas has a meter that registers the amount of gas consumed.
This meter is placed on the service pipe on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
house side of the above-mentioned stop cock. This meter
is furnished free of charge with a trivial charge made for
setting up. The actual setting of this meter is not made
until the piping throughout the building has had a thorough
and satisfactory test and is found free from all leaks. The
meter must be set level on a substantial bracket and in a
place, if possible, where it will not require an artificial light
to read its dial. The dry meter is usually used in dwellings.
The interesting construction and mechanism of this meter
cannot be discussed here.</p>

<div class="figs">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig_77" id="Fig_77"></a><a href="images/fig77.gif"><img src="images/fig77tn.gif" width="500" height="326" class="plain" alt="Fig. 77.--Gas-meter dials." title="Fig. 77.&mdash;Gas-meter dials." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 77.&mdash;Gas-meter dials.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The reading of the dials on a gas meter comes in the province
of the plumber and he should be able to read them.
The sketch shows the dial plate of a meter. The ordinary
house meter has only three recording dials. Large meters
have five or more. To read the amount of gas consumed
according to the meter we will read the dials as they are
indicated on <a href="#Fig_77">Fig. 77</a>. We will call the four dials No. 1,
No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4. In each of these dials a complete revolution
of the index hand denotes 1,000, 10,000, 100,000 and
1,000,000, cubic feet respectively. The index hands on No.
1 and No. 3 revolve in the same direction, while No. 2 and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
No. 4 revolve in the opposite direction. Two ciphers are
added to the figures that are indicated on the dials and the
statement of the meter will be had. To tell just how much
gas has been consumed in a given time, the statement of the
meter is taken at the beginning of this given time and at the
end of the time. The difference in the figures indicates the
number of cubic feet of gas that have been consumed. A
gas cock should be placed on the house side of the meter.
The dials of meter read 658,800 cubic feet. The dial
having the highest number is read first No. 4 dial points
to 6, this indicates that No. 3 dial has revolved 6 times.
Dial No. 3 reads 5, therefore the reading of dial No. 3 and
No. 4 is 65. Dial No. 2 reads 8 making the readings of
the three dials 658. Dial No. 1 reads 8 making the readings
of the four dials 6588 add two ciphers to this figure
and 658,800 is the correct reading.</p>

<p><b>Pipe and Fittings.</b>&mdash;The pipe used in gas fitting is wrought
iron or steel. In special places, rubber hose is used. Brass
pipe is occasionally used to advantage. The fittings used
in iron pipe gas work should be galvanized. No plain fittings
should be allowed. The plain fittings very often
have sand holes in them and a leak will result. Sometimes
this leak does not appear until after the piping has been
in use some time and the expense of replacing the fitting
can only be guessed at. By using galvanized fittings, this
trouble will be eliminated. All fittings used should be of
the beaded type. The fitting and measurement of this
work is practically the same as described under iron pipe
work. To have the beginner get a clearer idea of gas-piping
a building, the piping of the small building sketched
will be gone over in detail and studied. One of the first
important steps that a gas fitter is confronted with is the
locating of the various lights and openings. With these
located as shown on the plan, Figs. <a href="#Fig_78">78</a>, <a href="#Fig_79">79</a> and <a href="#Fig_80">80</a>, we will
proceed to work out the piping. The first floor rise will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
1-inch, the second floor will be 1-inch. The horizontal pipe
supplying the first floor outlets will be <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>-inch pipe. The
horizontal pipe on the second floor will be <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>-inch. The
balance of the pipe will be <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>- or <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-inch. At this point
your attention is called to the sketch of piping, sizes, and
measurements. This sketch should be studied and understood
in detail. The good mechanic will employ a sketch
of this kind when installing any piping. The poor mechanic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
will take two or three measurements and get them out,
put them in, and then get some more. This method is
extremely costly and unworkmanlike. There is no reason,
except the ability of the workman, why he cannot take a
building like the sketch and get all the piping measurements
for the job, then get them out, go to the job and put
them in. The amount of time saved in this way is so great
that a workman should not consider himself a full-fledged
mechanic until he can get the measurements this way, and
get them accurately. With a tape line, gimlet, and plumb-bob,
a mechanic is fully equipped with tools to get his
measurements. If the measurements are taken with a tape
line, the same tape line should be used when measuring
the pipe and cutting it. When laying out the piping, never
allow a joist to be cut except within 6 inches of its bearing.
It is good policy never to cut timber unless absolutely
necessary and then only after consulting with the carpenter.
When joists have to be notched they should be
cut only on the top side. The pipe as it is put in place
should be braced rigidly. Wherever there is an outlet
pipe extending through the wall, the pipe should be braced
from all sides so that when the fixture is screwed in it will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
be perfectly rigid.</p>

<div class="figs">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig_80" id="Fig_80"></a><a href="images/fig80.gif"><img src="images/fig80tn.gif" width="500" height="255" class="plain" alt="Fig. 80." title="Fig. 80." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 80.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The measurements on the piping sketch, <a href="#Fig_81">Fig. 81</a>, are
taken from the accompanying sketch of a dwelling, and if
they were to be actually put in, they would fit. The reader
would do well to copy this sketch and follow the piping
and check the measurements according to the plan, and
note how the different risers, drops, etc., are drawn. It
is not necessary in a sketch of this kind to draw to a scale.
After the different measurements are the letters <i>C.C.</i>,
<i>E.C.</i>, <i>E.E.</i>, <i>C.B.</i> and <i>E.B.</i>, meaning center to center, end
to center, end to end, center to back, and end to back,
respectively. Offsetting pipe is a very convenient way of
getting the pipe or fittings back to the wall for support.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
To offset pipe properly and with little trouble, take a piece
of scantling 2 by 4 and brace it between the floor and
ceiling. Bore a few different-sized holes through it and
you will have a very handy device for offsetting pipe.
There is a little trick in offsetting pipe that one will have to
practice to obtain. The pipe must be held firmly in the
place where the pipe is to be bent. Large offsets and bends
should not be made; 2 to 4 inches is as large as should be
used. Larger offsets that are required should be made
with fittings. Always make the offsets true and have the
ends perfectly straight. Before putting a piece of pipe permanently
in place, always look or blow through it, to ascertain
if its bore is obstructed or not. Sometimes dirt or slag
will collect and cause stoppage.</p>

<div class="figs">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig_81" id="Fig_81"></a><a href="images/fig81.gif"><img src="images/fig81tn.gif" width="300" height="406" class="plain" alt="Fig. 81.--Pipe sketch." title="Fig. 81.&mdash;Pipe sketch." /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 81.&mdash;Pipe sketch.</span>
</div></div>

<p><b>Reading the Pipe Sketch.</b>&mdash;Vertical lines represent
vertical pipes (see <a href="#Fig_81">Fig. 81</a>). Horizontal lines represent
horizontal pipes running parallel to the front. Diagonal
lines represent horizontal pipes running from back to
front. Any line that is drawn perpendicular to any other
line stands for a horizontal pipe. A diagonal line separating
a vertical line or horizontal line or set of lines represents
a different horizontal plane. With this explanation the
sketch will be made clear to one after drawing it. The
reader should now take each measurement and check it on
the plan. This is easily done by using a scale rule. The
height of the ceiling is 8<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> feet on the first floor, the second
floor is 8 feet. The first floor joists are 10 inches, the second
floor joists are 9 inches. An outlet is indicated by a small
circle. In the piping sketch, this circle is connected with
the riser or drop by a horizontal line. At the junction of
these two lines a short perpendicular line is drawn, and indicates
the direction of the outlet.</p>

<p>Let me again emphasize the need to understand thoroughly
this piping sketch, and to become so familiar with
it that it can readily be put to use. The value of a mechanic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
is determined by the quality and the quantity of work
that he can turn out; and a mechanic who can lay out his
work and see it completed before he starts, and then proceeds
to install his work, is by far of more value to his employer
than the man who can see only far enough ahead to
cut out two or three measurements and spends most of his
time walking between the vise and place of installing the
pipe.</p>

<p><b>Testing.</b>&mdash;The system of gas piping must be tested before
the pipes have been covered by the advance of building
operations. If the job is of considerable size, the job can
be tested in sections, and if found tight the sections can be
covered. The necessity of having the piping rigidily
secured can be appropriately explained here. If the test
has been made and the system found tight and some pipe
that is not securely anchored is accidentally or otherwise
pushed out of place and bent by some of the mechanics
working about the building, a leak may be caused and yet
not discovered until the final test is made after the plastering
is finished. The expense and trouble thus caused is considerable
and could have been avoided by simply putting
in the proper supports for the pipe.</p>

<p>To test the piping, an air pump and a gage connected
with the pipes are placed in a convenient position. The
job should now be thoroughly gone over, making sure that
all plugs and caps are on and that no outlet is open, also
that all pipe that is to be put in has been installed. After
this has been attended to, the pump is operated until 10
pounds is registered on the gage. The connection leading
to the pump and the piping is now shut off. If the gage
drops rapidly, there is a bad leak in the system. This
leak should be found without difficulty and repaired. If
the gage drops slowly, it denotes a very small leak, such as
a sand hole or a bad thread. This kind of leak is more
troublesome to find. When it has been found, the pipe or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
fitting causing the leak should be taken out and replaced.
If black caps have been used to cap the outlets, the chances
are that a sand hole will be found in one of them. Nothing
but galvanized fittings should be used. In case the small
leak mentioned above cannot be found by going over the
pipe once, there are other means of locating the leak. Two
of the methods used, I will explain. If the job is small,
each fitting is painted with soap suds until the fitting is
found that causes the leak. If the leak is not in the fittings,
then the pipe can be gone over in the same way. As soon as
the soap suds strikes the leak, a large bubble is made and
the leak discovered. It is possible that there are more leaks,
so the gage is noted and if it still drops, the search should
be continued. The pump should be operated to keep the
pressure up to 10 pounds while the search is being made
for the leak. When the gage stands at 10 pounds without
dropping, the job is then tight. The pump and gage fitting
should be gone over first to ascertain if they leak. The
other method employed to discover leaks is to force a little
ether or oil of peppermint (not essence) into the system by
means of the pump. A leak can readily be noted by the
odor. To make this method successful, the ether or peppermint
should not be handled by the men who are to hunt
for the leak. The bottle containing the fluid should not
be opened in the building except to pour some into the
piping, otherwise the odor will get into the building and as
the odor comes out of the leak it will not be noted. For
the benefit of the gas fitter, the piping should be tested again
after the plastering is completed. The next test is made
when the fixtures are put on, and as the piping is tight any
leak that develops in this test indicates that the fixtures
leak. There are in common use various methods to stop
leaks in gas pipe when they are found. If a piece of piping
or a fitting is defective, it should be taken out and replaced.
This should be remembered so that while the piping is being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
installed any defects should be noted and the defective fitting
or pipe thrown out. Before the gas job is accepted,
the gas company will inspect it and look for traps and sags
in the pipe. Therefore, the piping should be installed without
any traps and it should be arranged to pitch toward
the meter, or toward a convenient place from which any
condensation can be taken out. If provision is not made
for this condensation, it will accumulate and stop the flow
of gas.</p>


<h3>SHOWER-BATH CONNECTIONS</h3>

<p>The sketches show clearly the methods employed to make
a shower-bath waste and stall water-tight. The shower
bath, as a separate fixture, is in use and the demand for it
as a separate fixture is increasing rapidly. This demand
comes from the owners of private houses. The plumber
must therefore devise some way to make these connections
tight and prevent any leak from showing in the room below.
This fixture is so constructed that all waste pipes and trap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
come under the floor level with no way of getting to them
from below. Therefore the piping for this fixture must be
of a permanent nature. No pipe or trap made of material
that is liable to give out in a short time should be allowed
under a shower-bath fixture or stall. The two sketches,
Figs. <a href="#Fig_82">82</a> and <a href="#Fig_83">83</a> illustrate two methods of connecting and
making tight a shower stall. A plumber should always
consider it his special duty to make his work complete and
free from all objections. He should always prepare for
any emergency that may occur in the future. This is
rather a big task, yet the plumber when accepting all of
his responsibilities has a big task. I state this to the
beginner and emphasize the all-important fact that he must
learn to perform and think deeply of the elements of
plumbing to be able later on to handle successfully the
problems that present themselves in the plumbing trade.</p>

<p>The heavy brass trap shown in the sketch has proved
itself very satisfactory and can be made to fit almost any
condition of piping or building construction. A flashing
of sheet lead is soldered on the trap and carried out to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
outside edge of the stall where it is turned up 1 inch, or to
the floor level. When the flashing is carried out for only a
foot on each side of the trap, the possibilities of a leak are
greater.</p>

<h3><a name="plumbing_code" id="plumbing_code"></a><span class="smcap">Plumbing Codes</span></h3>


<p>The work of plumbing has a direct result on the health of
the occupants of buildings; therefore in order that the
plumbing may not be installed improperly and impair the
health of the occupants, it is necessary to provide a code
governing the installation of plumbing. Naturally these
laws at first were under the control of the health department
of cities, but of late years the building departments have
assumed control of the codes with the result that co&ouml;peration
with the building codes is now the practice rather than
the exception.</p>

<p>To make certain the carrying out of the plumbing codes,
it is required that a plan indicating the run, size, and length
of pipes, location and number of fixtures of the prospective
job be filed in the building department of the city, before
the work is started. If the plan is approved by the plumbing
inspector and acceptance is sent, then the work can be
started. After a job is completed a test is made and the
job is inspected by the plumbing inspector, and if found to
meet requirements a written acceptance of the work is
given by the building department. An effort is being made
throughout the country to have the plumbing codes under
State control rather than have a number of different codes
in as many different cities and towns. The State code can
be so arranged that it will apply to either city or town.</p>

<p>The installation of plumbing varies in different States.
In the northern part of the United States all pipes which
pass through the roof, if less than 4-inch must be increased
to 4-inch. A pipe smaller than 4-inch will be filled with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
hoar frost during the winter and render the pipe useless to
perform its function as a vent pipe. Pipes laid under
ground in the Northern States must be at least 4 feet below
the surface to protect them from freezing. In the Southern
States the frost does not penetrate the ground to such a
distance and the pipes can be laid on the surface.</p>

<p>Following is a State or City plumbing code insofar as
it relates to the actual installation of plumbing.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sec_1" id="Sec_1"></a>Sec. 1. Plans and Specifications.</span>&mdash;There shall be a separate
plan for each building, public or private, or any addition thereto,
or alterations thereof, accompanied by specifications showing
the location, size and kind of pipe, traps, closets and fixtures to
be used, which plans and specifications shall be filed with the board
or bureau of buildings. The said plans and specifications shall
be furnished by the architect, plumber or owner, and filed by the
plumber. All applications for change in plans must be made in
writing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sec_2" id="Sec_2"></a>Sec. 2. Filing Plans and Specifications.</span>&mdash;Plumbers before
commencing the construction of plumbing work in any building
(except in case of repairs, which are here defined to relate to the
mending of leaks in soil, vent, or waste pipes, faucets, valves and
water-supply pipes, and shall not be construed to admit of the
replacing of any fixture, such as water closets, bath tubs, lavatories,
sinks, etc., or the respective traps for such fixtures) shall
submit to the bureau plans and specifications, legibly drawn in
ink, on blanks to be furnished by said board or bureau. Where
two or more buildings are located together and on the same
street, and the plumbing work is identical in each, one plan will
be sufficient. Plans will be approved or rejected within 24 hours
after their receipt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sec_3" id="Sec_3"></a>Sec. 3. Material of House Drain and Sewer.</span>&mdash;House
drains or soil pipes laid beneath floor must be extra heavy cast-iron
pipe, with leaded and caulked joints, and carried 5 feet
outside cellar wall. All drains and soil pipes connected with
main drain where it is above the cellar floor shall be extra heavy
cast-iron pipe with leaded joints properly secured or of heavy
wrought-iron pipe with screw joints properly secured and carried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
5 feet outside cellar wall and all arrangements for soil and waste
pipes shall be run as direct as possible. Changes of direction on
pipes shall be made with "Y"-branches, both above and below
the ground, and where such pipes pass through a new foundation-wall
a relieving arch shall be built over it, with a 2-inch space on
either side of the pipe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sec_4" id="Sec_4"></a>Sec.</span> 4.&mdash;The size of main house drain shall be determined by
the total area of the buildings and paved surfaces to be drained,
according to the following table, if iron pipe is used. If the pipe
is terra-cotta the pipe shall be one size larger than for the same
amount of area drainage.</p>

<p>The main house drains may be decreased in diameter beyond
the rain-water conductor or surface inlet by permission of the
bureau, when the plans show that the conditions are such as to
warrant such decrease, but in no case shall the main house drain
be less than 4 inches in diameter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sec_5" id="Sec_5"></a>Sec. 5. Main Trap.</span>&mdash;An iron running trap with two clean-outs
must be placed in the house drain near the front wall of the
house, and on the sewer side of all connections. If placed outside
the house or below the cellar floor the clean-outs must extend to
surface with brass screw cap ferrules caulked in. If outside the
house, it must never be placed less than 4 feet below the surface
of the ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sec_6" id="Sec_6"></a>Sec. 6. Fresh-air Inlet.</span>&mdash;A fresh-air inlet pipe must be
connected with the house drain just inside of the house trap and
extended to the outer air, terminating with a return bend, or a
vent cap or a grating with an open end 1 foot above grade at the
most available point to be determined by the building department.</p>

<p>The fresh-air inlet pipe must be 4 inches in diameter for house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
drains of 6 inches or less and as much larger as the building department
may direct for house drains more than 6 inches in diameter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sec_7" id="Sec_7"></a>Sec. 7. Laying of House Sewers and Drains.</span>&mdash;House
sewers and house drains must, where possible, be given an even
grade to the main sewer of not less than <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> inch to the foot.
Full-sized "Y"- and "T"-branch fittings for handhole clean-outs

<p>All cast-iron pipe must be tested to 50 pounds and marked with
the maker's name.</p>

<p>All joints in cast-iron pipe must be made with picked oakum
and molten lead and caulked gas-tight. Twelve ounces of soft
pig lead must be used at each joint for each inch in the diameter
of the pipe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sec_10" id="Sec_10"></a>Sec. 10. Wrought-iron and Steel Pipe.</span>&mdash;All wrought-iron
and steel pipe shall be galvanized. Fittings used for drainage
must be galvanized and of recess type known as drainage fittings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
All fittings used for venting shall be galvanized and of the style
known as steam pattern. No plain black pipe or fittings will be
permitted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sec_11" id="Sec_11"></a>Sec. 11. Sub-soil Drains.</span>&mdash;Sub-soil drains must be discharged
into a sump or receiving tank, the contents of which must be
lifted and discharged into the drainage system above the cellar
floor by some approved method. Where directly sewer-connected,
they must be cut off from the rest of the building and plumbing
system by a brass flap valve on the inlet to the catch basin and
the trap on the drain from the catch basin must be water-supplied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sec_12" id="Sec_12"></a>Sec. 12. Yard and Area Drains.</span>&mdash;All yard, area and court
drains when sewer-connected must have connection not less than
4 inches in diameter. They should be controlled by one trap&mdash;the
leader trap if possible. All yards, areas and courts must be drained.
Tenement houses and lodging houses must have yards, areas and
courts drained into sewer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sec_13" id="Sec_13"></a>Sec. 13. Use of Old Drains and Sewers.</span>&mdash;Old house drains
and sewers may be used in connection with new buildings or new
plumbing, only when they are found, on examination by the
department of building, to conform in all respects to the requirements
governing new sewers and drains. All extensions to old
house drains must be of extra heavy cast-iron pipe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sec_14" id="Sec_14"></a>Sec. 14. Leader Pipes.</span>&mdash;All building shall be provided with
proper metallic leaders for conducting water from the roofs in
such manner as shall protect the walls and foundations of such
buildings from injury. In no case shall the water from such
leaders be allowed to flow upon the sidewalk but the same shall
be conducted by a pipe or pipes to the sewer. If there is no
sewer in the street upon which such building fronts, then the
water from said leader shall be conducted, by proper pipes below
the surface of the sidewalk, to the street gutter.</p>

<p>Inside leaders shall be constructed of cast iron, wrought iron
or steel, with roof connections made gas-and water-tight by means
of heavy copper drawn tubing slipped into the pipe. The tubing
must slip at least 7 inches into the pipe. Outside leaders may
be of sheet metal, but they must connect with the house drain
by means of cast-iron pipe extending vertically 5 feet above grade<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
level, where the building is located along public driveways or sidewalks.
Where the building is located off building line, and not
liable to be damaged the connection shall be made with iron pipe
extending 1 foot above the grade level.</p>

<p>All leaders must be trapped with running traps of cast iron, so
placed as to prevent freezing.</p>

<p>Rain leaders must not be used as soil, waste or vent pipes, nor
shall such pipes be used as rain leaders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sec_15" id="Sec_15"></a>Sec. 15.&mdash;Exhaust from Steam Pipes, Etc.</span>&mdash;No steam discharge
or exhaust, blow-off or drip pipe shall connect with the
sewer or the house drain, leader, soil pipe, waste or vent pipe.
Such pipes shall discharge into a tank or condenser, from which
suitable outlet to the sewer shall be made. Such condenser
shall be supplied with water, to help condensation and help
protect the sewer, and shall also be supplied with relief vent to
carry off dry steam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sec_16" id="Sec_16"></a>Sec. 16. Diameter of Soil Pipe.</span>&mdash;The smallest diameter
of soil pipe permitted to be used shall be 4 inches. The size of

their water levels. No pot, bottle or "D" trap will be permitted
nor any form of trap that is not self-cleaning, nor that has interior
chambers or mechanism nor any trap except earthenware ones
that depend upon interior partitions for a seal. In case there is
an additional fixture required in building and it is impossible to
re-vent pipe for the trap, the building department may designate
the kind of trap to be used. This shall not be construed to allow
traps without re-vents in new buildings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sec_27" id="Sec_27"></a>Sec. 27. Safe and Refrigerator Pipes.</span>&mdash;Safe-waste pipes
must not connect directly with any part of the plumbing system.
Safe-waste pipes must discharge over an open, water-supplied,
publicly-placed, ordinary-used sink, placed not more than 3<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>
feet above the cellar floor. The safe waste from a refrigerator
must be trapped at the bottom of the line only and must not discharge
upon the ground floor, but over an ordinary open pan, or
some properly-trapped, water-supplied sink, as above. In no
case shall the refrigerator waste pipe discharge into a sink located
in a living room.</p>

<p>The branches on vertical lines must be made by means of "Y"
fittings and be carried to the safe with as much pitch as possible.
Where there is an offset on the refrigerator waste pipe in the cellar,
there must be clean-outs placed. These clean-outs must be of
brass.</p>

<p>In tenement and lodging houses the refrigerator waste pipe
must extend above the roof, and not be larger than 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> inches and
the branches not smaller than 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> inches. Refrigerator waste
pipes, except in tenement houses, and all safe-waste pipes, must
have brass flap valve on the lower ends. Lead safes must be
graded and neatly turned over beveled strips at their edges.</p>

<li>2 inches in diameter for 3 inch to 4 inch trap.</li>
<li>One-half their diameter, for traps 3 inches and over.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where two or more closets are placed side by side, on a horizontal
branch, the branch line shall have a relief extended as a
loop. A pipe 2 inches in diameter shall be sufficient as a loop vent
for two closets. A pipe 3 inches in diameter shall be sufficient
as a relief for three or four closets; and where more than four
closets are located on the same branch the relief shall not be less
than 4 inches in diameter. All house drains and soil lines on
which a water closet is located must have a 4-inch main vent line.
Where an additional closet is located in the cellar or basement,
and within 10 feet of main soil or vent line, no relief vent will be
required for said closet; but where it is more than 10 feet, a 2-inch
vent line will be required. Relief vent pipes for water closets
must not be less than 2 inches in diameter, for a length of 40 feet,
and not less than 3 inches in diameter, for more than 40 feet.</p>

<p>No re-vent from traps under bell traps will be required.</p>

<p>In any building having a sewer connection with a private or
public sewer used for bell-trap connections or floor drainage only,
a 2-inch relief line must be extended to the roof of the building
from rear end of main. House drains, constructed for roof drainage
only, will not require a relief vent.</p>

<p>A floor trap for a shower shall be vented, unless located in the
cellar or ground floor the paving of which renders the trap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
inaccessible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sec_30" id="Sec_30"></a>Sec. 30. Horizontal Vent Pipes.</span>&mdash;Where rows of fixtures
are placed in a line, fitting of not less than 45&deg; to the horizontal
must be used on vent lines to prevent filling with rust or condensation;
except on brick or tile walls, where it is necessary to channel
same for pipes, 90&deg; fittings will be allowed. Trapped vent pipes
are strictly prohibited. No vent pipe from the house side of any
trap shall connect with the ventilation pipe or with sewer, soil or
waste pipe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sec_31" id="Sec_31"></a>Sec. 31. Offset on Vent Lines.</span>&mdash;All offsets on vent lines
must be made at an angle of not less than 45&deg; to the horizontal,
and all lines must be connected at the bottom with a soil or waste
pipe, or the drain, in such manner as to prevent the accumulation
of rust, scale or condensation.</p>

<p>No sheet metal, brick, or other flue shall be used as a vent pipe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sec_32" id="Sec_32"></a>Sec. 32. Setting of Fixtures.</span>&mdash;All fixtures must be set open
and free from all enclosing woodwork. Water closets and urinals
must not be connected directly or flushed from the water-supply
pipes except when flushometer valves are used. Each water
closet must be flushed from a separate cistern, the water from
which is used for no other purpose, or may be flushed through
flushometer valves.</p>

<p>Rubber connection and elbows are not permitted.</p>

<p>Pan, plunger, or hopper closets will not be permitted in any
building. No range closet either wet or dry, nor any evaporating
system of closets shall be constructed or allowed inside of any
building.</p>

<p>A separate building constructed especially for the purpose, must
be provided in which such range closets shall be set.</p>

<p>All earthenware traps must have heavy brass floor flange plates,
soldered to the lead bends and bolted to the trap flange, and the
joint made permanently secure and gas-tight.</p>

<p>In all buildings sewer-connected there must be at least one water
closet in each building. There must be a sufficient number of
water closets so that there will never be more than 15 people
to each water closet.</p>

<p>Separate water closets and toilet rooms must be provided for
each sex in buildings used as workshops, office buildings, factories,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
hotels and all places of public assembly.</p>

<p>In all buildings the water closet and urinal apartments must be
ventilated into the outer air by windows opening on the same lot
as the building is situated on or by a ventilating skylight placed
over each room or apartment where such fixtures are located.</p>

<p>In all buildings the outside partition of any water closet or
urinal apartment must be air-tight and extend to the ceiling or
be independently ceiled over. When necessary to light such
apartments properly the upper part of the partition must be
provided with translucent glass. The interior partitions of such
apartments must be dwarfed partitions.</p>

<p>In alteration work where it is not practicable to ventilate a
closet or urinal apartment by windows or skylight to the outer
air, there must be provided a sheet-iron duct extending to the
outer air, the area of the duct must be at least 144 square inches
for one water closet or urinal, and an additional 72 square inches
for each addition closet or urinal added therein.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sec_33" id="Sec_33"></a>Sec. 33. Urinals.</span>&mdash;All urinals must be constructed of materials
impervious to moisture and that will not corrode under the action
of urine. The floors and walls of urinal apartments must be lined
with similar non-absorbent and non-corrosive material.</p>

<p>The platforms and treads of urinal stalls must be connected
independently of the plumbing system, nor can they be connected
with any safe-waste pipe.</p>

<p>The copper lining of water closet and urinal cisterns must not
be lighter than 12 ounces copper, and must be stamped on lining
with maker's name. Where lead is used it must not weigh less
than 4 pounds to the square foot. All other materials are
prohibited.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sec_34" id="Sec_34"></a>Sec. 34. Fixtures Prohibited.</span>&mdash;Wooden wash trays, sinks,
or bath tubs are prohibited inside buildings. Such fixtures must
be constructed of non-absorbent materials. Cement or artificial
stone tubs will not be permitted, unless approved by the plumbing
inspector and building department.</p>

<p>Yard water closets will not be permitted except as approved
by the plumbing inspector and then passed by the building
department.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sec_35" id="Sec_35"></a>Sec. 35. Privy Vaults and Cesspools.</span>&mdash;No privy vault or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
cesspool for sewage, shall be constructed in any part of the city
where a sewer is at all accessible. In parts of the city where no
sewer exists privy vaults and cesspools shall not be located within
2 feet of party or street line nor within 20 feet of any building.
Before these are constructed application for permission therefore
shall be made to the building department.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sec_36" id="Sec_36"></a>Sec. 36. Material and Workmanship.</span>&mdash;All material used in
the work of plumbing and drainage must be of good quality and
